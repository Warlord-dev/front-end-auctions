     <p className={styles.text5}>The dictionary definition of precarity is the state of being precarious— that is, being dependent on chance circumstances, unknown conditions, or uncertain developments.
<br/><br/>
It's the state of flux created by living through times of constant precariousness.
<br/><br/>
Precarity is a mundane reality experienced by everyone as an existential state of being — one where we implicitly develop mechanisms to allow us to feel a smidgen of control and certainty in this all-too impermanent, illusory plane we inhabit. 
<br/><br/>
Without a shadow of a doubt, precarity is a self-perpetuating cycle — and the increasing disaffection bedeviling the younger generation is a symptom of this ever-present dread of an increasingly bleak future.
<br/><br/>
One where access to a stable job, a dignified income, and the right to housing is rapidly diminishing, and where one has to hustle day in and day out just to make ends meet. 
<br/><br/>
Unemployment is at record levels. Flora and fauna are going extinct faster than any other time in recent history. War, famine, and disease are constants in this inherently flawed world we all live in. The economy remains turgid, and governments worldwide are failing their populations as far as reacting to their needs are concerned. 
<br/><br/>
Worse, the staggering ball and chain of debt cast onto the shoulders of every individual feel like the weight of the sky that poor Atlas was sentenced to carry for his role in leading the Titans against the battle of the Olympian gods in the cosmic Royal Rumble at Mount Olympus some millennia back. 
<br/><br/>
The debt phenomenon created a broken economy where debt slavery in the form of credit, student loans, and long-term mortgages props up these shambles of an economy while protecting the 1% that benefit from the entire goddamn system. The rest are left to their own devices, underpaid, underemployed, and miserable as they live out unfulfilling lives in a system they never asked to be part of. 
<br/><br/>
The pandemic is going to have some nightmarish, far-ranging repercussions in the next coming years, and there are yet Pandora's boxes to open as we march shambolically into the future as the house of cards grows ever so heavier day in, day out. Being stuck at home for over a year and counting hasn't helped much to assuage this constant, foreboding sense of doom that's always just around the corner.
<br/><br/>
One thing's for certain: the impact of eternal precarity exacerbated with the stresses of pandemic living, war, famine, ecological destruction, unemployment, and economic inequality has taken an unprecedented toll on our collective mental health as a species.
