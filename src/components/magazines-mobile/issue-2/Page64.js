      <p className={styles.text1}>E-SPORTS PLAYER OF THE MONTH</p>
      <p className={styles.text2}>N0TAIL</p>
      <p className={styles.text3}>With the Dota 2 TI coming up, N0tail is a player that can’t be looked past. He’s one of the most salient players in the entire Dota 2 pro-scene, having led his team, OG, to victory two-times with TI and overcome a mountain of obstacles in order to make that happen. He’s also accumulated well over 20,000 hours of Dota playtime— he must have a good gamer chair indeed! </p>
      <p className={styles.text5}>metaverse ready score: 6</p>
      <p className={styles.text4}>E-SPORTS RISING STAR OF THE MONTH</p>
      <p className={styles.text6}>At 19, Remo Arets is showing huge promise. He’s already reached 6th place in the EU MMR leaderboard & 2nd in EU’s lower DPC division with his team Creepwave.</p>
      <p className={styles.text7}>Crystallis</p>
      <p className={styles.text8}>metaverse ready score: 8</p>
      <p className={styles.text9}>He’s a refreshing new face to Dota 2 and in stark contrast to many players who have proceeded him— where he is known for his calm and no-nonsense attitude. </p>
      <p className={styles.text10}>WILD RIFT PATCH 2.3</p>
      <p className={styles.text11}>League of Legends mobile version is introducing 4 new champions as well as a plethora of new skins for the game. Both Riven and Irelia headlined as upcoming champions to Wild Rift.</p>
      <p className={styles.text12}>THE OLYMPICS HAS GONE DIGITIAL</p>
      <p className={styles.text13}>It’s official, the Olympics just went digital! Playstation announced the first-ever Olympic Virtual Series Motor Sport Event. The event is one of five in the virtual series, the others being cycling, rowing, sailing, and baseball.
<br/><br/>
Seems like just another waypoint for the metaverse. </p>
      <p className={styles.text14}>ACADEMIA FOr ESPORTS</p>
      <p className={styles.text15}>Staffordshire University first made headlines in 2017 upon announcement of the first esports degree, where now there are currently 380 students overall, across the three years and at a Master’s level.
      <br/><br/>
However, controversy has prevailed, with many students, staff, onlookers speaking up in belief that the entire degree was nothing more than a quick cash grab— where the course has proved out to be led by those with not only no industry or domain knowledge within esports, but also no true intention to craft content and materials that will legitimately equip enrolled students for being able to further pilot esports into the metaverse.  </p>
      <p className={styles.text16}>DREAM ADMISSION</p>
      <p className={styles.text17}>Probably the most well known Minecraft content creator, Dream, recently admitted to cheating in Minecraft speedruns. He admitted to using a disallowed modification during the run but claimed he was unaware the mod was active at the time.
      <br/><br/>
Overall, the controversy has gone on for many months, with Dream initially actively arguing against the results of Speedrun.com’s investigation. It’s been a pretty toxic turmoil for the whole community involved, but, it seems now there is some conclusion for moving forward. </p>
