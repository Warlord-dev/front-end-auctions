        It’s hard to compare the energy consumption of one country to a global financial system because they are two different sets. 
        Therefore, critics must use the global electricity consumption rate and compare it with the usage rate for cryptocurrencies. 
        If they delve into that perspective, the opposition will realize that cryptos account for a tiny portion of the annual consumption rate.

        Renewable sources are already powering a portion of coin mining’s energy consumption, and the trend will only rise in the future. 
        But in the meantime, mining operations opt for the most cost-efficient option. 
        No wonder they are seeking sources of hydroelectric and geothermal power to fuel their operations. But aside from cutting energy costs, 
        there are other factors that miners consider before setting up shop.
        <br/><br/>
        First, they look for local power plants that are producing an energy surplus. 
        Next, fast and reliable internet is a must because mining happens online. 
        Third, it must be a place that has a stable government that encourages more investments. 
        Finally, the area must have a low average temperature for hardware cooldown. That said, most mining operations are present in China, the United States, and Canada.

        Digital coin mining operations often opt for hydroelectric power to keep their devices going. 
        Aside from being an inexpensive option, it possesses the most abundant supply of renewable energy. 
        If renewable sources compensate for 24.5 percent of the global electricity usage rage, about two-thirds of which are from hydroelectric power plants.

        In terms of NFTs, Beeple and other digital artists sold artworks that reduced carbon footprint. 
        To continually spread the goodness, Yale University’s Open Earth Foundation receives the sale proceeds, 
        which will help them account for the atmospheric carbon footprint properly. 
        Each artwork comes with a unique token that corresponds to carbon credits from a Peruvian deforestation registry.
        <br/><br/>
        The time comes when most mining operations will use clean and renewable energy. 
        When that scenario becomes attainable, the naysayers will remain quiet because their arguments became obsolete. 
        When it finally arrives, those who are part of the universal basic income initiatives through Circles, GoodDollar,  
        $UBI will be proud of providing a system that is both morally and environmentally rewarding. This revolution is just around the corner.
