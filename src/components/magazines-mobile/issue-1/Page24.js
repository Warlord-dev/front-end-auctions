        <h2>Fashion is Evolving Towards Extended Reality — And That's a Good Thing</h2>
        <div className={styles.textContainer}>
          <p>The coronavirus pandemic has gone from conquest to conquest, leaving entire industries devastated in its wake and forcing them to rethink their position in the "new normal" we've all been forced to accept. A new normal rife with lockdowns, flight restrictions, store closures, social distancing, and global disruption on a scale we haven't experienced as a species since World War II.</p>
          <p> For better or worse, COVID-19 became the catalyst for widespread acceleration across all aspects of commerce, and the trillion-dollar fashion industry is no exception.</p>
          <p>After all, the only constant thing in the physical world we live in is change — and the truth is, the fashion industry hasn't changed much since the early aughts.</p>
          <p>If there's anything the industry ever taught us, it is this: nothing is too big to fail. And no industry is resistant to change.</p>
          <p> The fashion industry's major retailers are losing their grip on the industry. On the other hand, e-commerce is booming as physical stores and showrooms, fast-fashion or haute couture notwithstanding, have faced scores of shutdowns worldwide. Employees across the supply chain have been furloughed or laid off. Meanwhile, everyone, including their grandmother — and that's not an understatement — has literally had to move their lives online.</p>
          <p>We're in the midst of a full-blown fashion revolution. And the emergence of several immersive technologies representing the vast realities in virtual environments that come in all sorts of acronyms is proof positive of this ongoing transformation: virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), which brands have employed to create bespoke customer experiences that their physical stores used to deliver, as well as mixed reality (MR), which combines both elements of the latter.</p>
          <p>AR, VR, and MR are categorized under the broader, more normie-friendly term comprising all three realities: extended reality, or XR — creating experiences wherein users themselves can bring digital assets into the physical realm and allow them to bring physical items into the digital realms.</p>
          <p>Extended reality is essentially another manifestation of the metaverse — the apotheosis of all virtual worlds, iterations of immersive realities, and the ever-growing internet.</p>
          <p>While fashion brands have been taking notice of the growing impact that XR has on consumer behavior even before the pandemic broke out, the acceleration towards the use of novel, advanced digital solutions, and platforms to distinguish themselves online. The field is heating up as XR is set to become an $80 billion market by 2025, and the applications for fashion are immense — and so is the potential for it to take over the fashion value chain.</p>
