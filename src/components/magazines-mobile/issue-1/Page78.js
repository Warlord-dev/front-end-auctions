            Just as the world is grasping the idea of digital art and NFTs, a real estate boom is breaking out. 
            And it's not happening in your backyard: it's happening in the virtual realms of the metaverse.

          In Hong Kong, the most expensive piece of real estate housing has been sitting on the market for three years, and you could own it for a cool $450 million. 
          It's a property located at the Peak, the most prestigious neighborhood in the most expensive real estate market in the world, 
          a colonial estate covering over 7,700 square meters, offering breathtaking views of the region, 
          secluded in an evergreen paradise of Victoria Peak with nary a neighbor in sight. 
          A buyer paid over $178 million for a mansion in the same affluent neighborhood, representing the most lucrative residential sale in the entire continent.
          <br /><br />

          $450 million isn't chump change. In fact, it's downright obscene in a world where 36% of the population live under less than $1 a day. 
          Local whispers talk about how outrageous the going prices for real estate in the area go, if not downright absurd. 
          More astounding is the fact that these homes and apartments that they're mostly empty. 
          What price is too much for a piece of real estate that's been depreciating since 1991?
          <br /><br />

          True enough, we as a species are terrible judges of an asset's value, particularly when they are pegged at a higher value than their actual utility really is. 
          It's the same reason why we find prices of real estate at the Peak, or a particular piece of art goes for eye-watering sums of money.
          <br /><br />

          But the truth is, asset values are determined by whatever society's collective agreement dictates it to be. It has nothing at all to do with utility.
          <br /><br />

          Art valuation works the same — its value is nothing more than what we agree on. It doesn't matter what materials went to its production or its utility. 
          That's why most of us mere mortals cannot process their true worth. If you think otherwise, then I've got some tulip bulbs for you to buy.

        It's only elementary that people would be shocked to find out when acclaimed auction house Christie's sold a piece of digital NFT artwork for $69 million — for a piece of art that doesn't physically exist. 

        The shock was mainly because most people find it hard to reconcile the value of a digital piece of art, whose production costs are next to nothing compared to the price it went for, and whose value is more closely tied to its scarcity (perceived or otherwise) than its actual utility.

        The same is happening for the real estate boom that's happening right under the collective industry's nose, and it's happening in the corners of the metaverse—the virtual worlds where not only digital art, real estate, avatars, and fashion can be bought and sold as NFTs. The world where digital natives and their avatars can explore, socialize, play, and live.

        he Value of Virtual Real Estate. Everybody gets digital art, but virtual real estate is a different thing. Why should anyone spend money on a virtual piece of real estate that doesn't exist in real life? What makes pixelated parcels of land on a virtual world accessible through a website a real, tangible asset?

        This requires a bit more context. That said, if you've ever played a video game — doesn't matter if it's on the Atari or the NES, or if it's Super Mario, FIFA, Final Fantasy, Fortnite, or Call of Duty — then you would know that as your character explores the virtual world, you'd be spending oodles and oodles of time roaming through the vast expanses of the countless artificial universes these games offer.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.section3}>
        And the virtually limitless expanses of virtual worlds provide opportunities for brands to market, advertise, or engage with the emerging digital population. In-game advertising, after all, is a multi-billion-dollar industry that needs no further introduction.

        Furthermore, virtual real estate presents an opportunity for companies to purchase virtual parcels of land within the metaverses that they form part of — and the possibilities are endless. Companies can build entire cityscapes within those metaverses and monetize them as they see fit— such as putting up a building and leasing out ad and store space, create living spaces that they can rent out, or any revenue-generating venture, for that matter. The possibilities are endless.

        Case in point: Beeple's $69 million NFT artwork entitled "Everydays: the First 5000 Days" was purchased by NFT fund founder and investor who goes by the pseudonym Metakovan. And based on his estimation, $69 million is a pittance compared to the value of what could be this generation's definitive piece of art, pegging its value at a staggering $1 billion. That's not a typo, and neither is it beyond the realm of imagination. Eventually, the crypto investor intends to create a virtual museum — yet another piece of virtual real estate — with which to display his vast collection of rare NFTs in the emergent metaverse.

        Think of how someone holding the NFT rights to the high-resolution video of Michael Jordan hitting the iconic game-winning shot over Bryon Russell in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals to win his sixth and last NBA Championship. The holder can then put it up for display within a virtual world where individuals can view it using their VR headset for a fee. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi plotline — but the technology is already here.
