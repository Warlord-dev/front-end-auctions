      <h1>The Long Thread of Textile History Continues</h1>
      <p className={styles.text1}>
        We owe a lot of what constitutes the fashion industry, as we know of it today, to India. In fact, our earliest knowledge about the origins and use of cotton can be dated back to a series of famous Indian poems written in 600BC. And, even Alexander the Great is recorded wearing cotton clothes after invading India with his troops. The nation has contributed a whole threadline of rich history to fashion globally, with about 1/3 of India’s textile production exported orientated, and the US standing as the biggest importer of Indian textile.

        Thus, it only seems fated that the region is now embracing the new world of fashiontech, which has been propelled over the past few months with the rise in relevance of NFTs and their harmonous affinity for finally bridging value and authenticity to digital fashion.

        We sat down with Ravi Singh, a newcomer to digital fashion yet avid supporter of inspiring traditional cultural inclusivity in the industry, and 3D desginer, Lorena Bello, to discuss their collaboration alongside DIGITALAX, on the world’s first Indian digital fashion collection.

        Last year, if you had told me that I’d be writing for the world’s first metaverse magazine about my Indian digital fashion collection, designed in collaboration with Lorena Bello, a world-renowned 3d fashion designer, I would have said you were confusing me for a character in a Marvel movie. After being on Indian Matchmaking on Netflix in 2020, I started to connect with South Asian influencers and artists around the world. Through an Indian streetwear brand, I attended New York Fashion Week, which inspired me to explore how to fuse South Asian culture with American identity. This spring, I learned about DIGITALAX, the world’s first digital fashion operating system, and how it’s designed to liberate gaming and fashion mods from gatekeepers to the masses.

        I was excited by the intersection of crypto and the metaverse – digital worlds layered on top of our physical reality. All these connections led me to want to build an Indian digital fashion collection, which is something I had never seen before. But this is more than about digital fashion – it’s about creating culturally inclusive spaces in the metaverse. It’s about inspiring more metaverse artists from all backgrounds, from Africa, to South America, to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

        The collection was inspired by Ravi, 3D modelled by Lorena and all scenes, animation and renders composed by DIGITALAX.

        From my first conversation with Ravi, I was completely behind the idea of bridging traditional culture into digital fashion. The opportunity to be a part of the world’s first digital fashion line based on Indian culture + make a disruptive point in South Asian fashion culture and open a new frontier in the digital fashion space.... to help bear Indian fashion into the Metaverse... I absolutely wanted to be involved!

        Not having a strong background in Indian Culture myself allowed me to work without preconceptions. After many virtual coffees NYC-Madrid I worked experimentally to best present the first cultural crossover into digital fashion.
