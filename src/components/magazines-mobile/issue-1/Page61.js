        Some game companies don't like their games get modded, they prefer to maintain complete control, keep everything behind a walled garden. But, modding is what keeps the game industry alive. It is what gives the devs and studios huge benefits, it’s what ensures that their games don’t die!

      <p className={styles.text2}>
        Modding is not an exclusive talent, anyone can become modder. The best place to start is join a community (Like devilmaycry.org !)... watch some youtube tutorials and take advice from others. Modding communities are incredibly active on forums and discord servers. Just dive in and start, it really is one of the most vibrant ecosystems, and, even if you don’t want to actually develop a mod, I can assure you that the gameplay is just as fun, so.. start by just playing, support other modders work!
