        <h6 className={styles.text1}>23 yr old  art and design student based in NYC at The New School, with an international upbringing, from Japan, NYC, Rome, and Abu Dhabi. </h6>
        <h6 className={styles.text2}>
          My digital creative work started when I was in elementary school, living in Abu Dhabi. I was exploring video editing and filmmaking, creating special effects videos with my friends. I continued pursuing film until I reached college where I began experimenting with other mediums, primarily clothing design. I was working on a graphic design based streetwear brand during my early years of college, spending most of the time practicing graphic design and learning how to sew physical garments. I always envisioned this streetwear brand having a digital presence with every physical garment being paired with a digital twin along with a native virtual world where the brand's customers could purchase the garments. It was during this time that I started growing a passion for futurism, technology, and virtual worlds. This ultimately drove me down many rabbit holes and finally last year I moved away from physical clothing, built a computer and dedicated myself to learning 3D modeling and building a prototype of this vision. During this process I have discovered blockchain, NFTs, and the Metaverse and have been truly blown away by the implications they hold.  
        </h6>
        <h6 className={styles.text3}>
          I began my 3D modeling journey less than a year ago (fall of 2020) so I am still very much in the learning stage trying to navigate all the tools available. My preferred software so far is definitely Blender. I’ve also spent time using Unity, Marvelous Designer, After Effects, Photoshop, and FL Studios for music.
        </h6>
        <h6 className={styles.text4}>
          XENOTECH is the natural extension to the previous physical streetwear brand I was building. My vision for XENOTECH has always and still is to become a Metaverse social-commerce virtual world targeting fashion designers and creatives alike. I am currently looking for people interested in helping me realize this. However, in respect to this being a longer-term resource intensive goal, in this early stage I am focused on first establishing XENOTECH as a digital streetwear brand exploring themes of futurism and the convergence of exponential technological trends.  
        </h6>
        <h6 className={styles.text5}>
          The shorter term plans for XENOTECH include first developing a collection of 3D NFT garments to be sold as XENOTECH exclusives. Then the aim is towards expanding into Metaverse wearables, since ultimately Digital Fashion is meant to have utility and be worn by owners' avatars. I am looking into Crytovoxels, Decentraland, and The Sandbox as potential starting points. Another short-term plan is to finalize the Cryptovoxels XENOTECH store which currently resides on the Milan island in Cryptovoxels, and to continue expanding to more retail locations across the Metaverse in order to start featuring other 3D clothing designers / brands by providing them digital storefront space.
        </h6>
        <h6 className={styles.text6}>
          When I was previously designing physical clothing I was always frustrated by the constraints faced when trying to work with my favorite fabrics such as Vinyl—they were a nightmare to sew with and ultimately very uncomfortable to wear. With digital fashion these constraints disappear and there are unlimited possibilities. Video Clothing and the use of physically-impossible fabrics and textures are some examples. My current process includes starting with graphic design or video editing in Photoshop or After Effects, then constructing a garment in Marvelous Designer, then using Blender to add graphics/videos, materials, and other 3D components.
          <br/><br/>
          In the short term I am looking towards releasing the first exclusive XENOTECH garment collection, and officially launching the XENOTECH Metaverse store in Cryptovoxels.
        </h6>

         The Singularity sweater is an early XENOTECH 3D garment—a prelude to the official first collection releasing soon. It speaks to the concept of an approaching technological singularity, a result of the convergence of countless different exponential disruptive technologies including Artificial Intelligence, genetic editing, and brain-computer interfaces.

        <p className={styles.text8}>
          This is the prototype of the 3D city that I built out to help visualize the way I imagine the XENOTECH Metaverse to look. Everything was modeled from scratch using Marvelous Designer and Blender, then Unity to put it all together. The graphics and video edits seen on the buildings were done using Photoshop and After Effects.
