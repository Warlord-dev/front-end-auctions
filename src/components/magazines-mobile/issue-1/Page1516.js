        If life is a game, it’s not played under fair rules. 
        The rich are getting more while the struggling ones continue to feel the brunt of the suffering. 
        People who argue that perseverance is the key out of poverty do not understand that sometimes, 
        the cards are stacked unfavorably with no easy way out. It’s not that the underprivileged are lazy. 
        Instead, the well-off have a considerable head start.

        Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the divide was already prominent. 
        The 2020 World Global Inequality Data by the World Inequality Lab highlights that Latin America and the Middle East are the most imbalanced regions for wealth distribution. 
        In these areas, the top ten wealthiest individuals make up 54 and 56 percent of the average national income, respectively.

        In Africa, the top ten percent own half of the national income. However, 
        the divide is more prominent in nations that experienced European colonization and racial injustice, 
        partly because of outdated taxation systems and the absence of land reform. 
        The Asian region saw the wealthiest possess close to 60 percent of income share, especially in India, wherein the difference in classes emerge even more.
