      Decentralised commerce facilitates global trade through its traceability. For instance, the ability to determine the exact state your cargo was shipped in–its origin, its provenance, its information, and its trustworthiness– is something that can be built using blockchain technologies to authenticate the lineage of a piece of clothing–or anything for that matter.
      <br /><br />
      Moreover, NFTs also allow brands and creators to protect their intellectual property from counterfeiting as a result of the same consequence. Each piece of apparel’s exact ownership lineage can be tracked to its source. Replicas and knockoffs wouldn’t have a reference on the blockchain’s publicly accessible ledger, making them easier to eradicate.
      <br /><br />
      Decentralised commerce, as enabled by Web 3.0, allows for a commercial model where customers have full ownership of their data and use it as they see fit, rather than sweating on the capricious whims of Amazon. And we’re seeing the first fruits of DeCo starting to emerge. No longer does anyone need to deal with another intermediary manipulating and extracting value at every stop of the supply chain. We’ve seen this happen in finance with the rise of DeFi: decentralised exchanges such as QuickSwap, NFT and collectibles marketplaces like OpenSea, SuperRare, and Rarible, to decentralised iterations of Amazon like Particl, which doesn’t spy on its users, apart from the creation of community-focused DeCo platforms, one of which is Origin; a protocol which allows merchants to run their own decentralised marketplaces they have full control of, apart from being free and resistant to censorship. Moreover, brands will now have the opportunity to tell their brand story as opposed to the Web 2.0 gatekeepers holding complete control over a third-party seller’s fate. Origin also allows brands to accept a wide array of ERC-20 tokens as well as traditional payment options such as credit cards. Paired with a fulfillment service like ShipBob, which essentially unbundles the vaunted fulfillment layer of Amazon and seeks to improve it. The possibilities are endless.
      <br /><br />
      But DeCo goes beyond mere iconoclasm, breaking legacy platforms, and creating slapdash decentralised iterations for the Amazons of the world. It takes the creation of interoperable, infinitely composable components that evolve and diffuse to eventually coalesce into new forms. Let the building begin.
