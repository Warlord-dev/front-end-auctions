      <p className={styles.text3}>Polish player, Michał "Nisha" Jankowski, holds a top ranking in the Esports world. He’s known for his Dota 2 gaming talent, having risen with the surge of Team Kinguin, where Nisha first appeared at ESL One Katowice in 2018. He is now competing with Team Secret and considered one of the best in his class with wins across the PVP Esports Championships, Chongqing Major and MDL Disneyland Paris Major, ESL One Katowice. </p>

      <p className={styles.text8}>19 year old South Korean League of Legends player Keria (Ryu Min-seok), has been a force to be reckoned with since he came out of DragonX with a move to the main roster in 2019, at just 17 years of age. Since then he’s continued to prove himself on T1 as one of their best young supports making up the bottom lane, as the entire team raises expectations for the upcoming Worlds. </p>
      <p className={styles.text10}>WILD tour brazil</p>
      <p className={styles.text11}>Riot has announced their regional  competitive circuit for Wild Rift with Wild Tour Brazil. It’s another avenue for esports competitors to the global stage as the tournament circuit begins with four open qualifiers that culminate not only in the Wild Rift Tour finale but also a chance for a slot in the inaugural Wild Rift World Championship 2021.

      <p className={styles.text15}>Esports’ close ties with celebrity and influencer culture just got closer, where Esports Fashion Week announced their latest partnership with Ford Models for fertilising personal brand building amongst pro gamers and their large fan bases. Whether or not social tokens is a next step after this remains unknown for now. However, either way, it’s definitely becoming apparent to many the need for more efficient and lucrative tools in building strengthened and aligned communities— maybe it’s an agency doing that work for now, but soon, don’t be surprised if the mechanics are automated by a few lines of Solidity.  </p>
