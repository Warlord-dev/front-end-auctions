      <p className={styles.text1}>Building in the Bazaar.</p>
      <p className={styles.text2}>
        Web3 at its core is an open bazaar of chaotic live fire markets, bustling open source development, vast creativity and decentralised tinkering of the very source code that gives so much vitality and wealth to NFTs, DeFi, Decentralised Commerce, DAOs and more. 
        <br /><br />
        Amongst all the noise there is an elegant coherence of signal, coordinating rapid code improvement and effective debugging so that designers, creators, players and everyday people are able to better start finding their way in this new world and embrace the market for its entire range of most important features and the full set of tools of what it can offer us.
        <br /><br />
        This complete breadth of optionality becomes so much more interesting given that in web3, for the first time, everything can be directly incentivised through streamlining the mechanisms for value exchange, securing it all through decentralisation and eliminating barriers to the creation of goods and services that you actually own— the bedrock and foundation to the open metaverse. 
        <br /><br />
        And it is only in building in such an open way that truly gives this market, and everyone a part of it, continuous opportunities to get better, at whatever that might be. Mistakes, big or small, core or peripheral, point us in the way toward getting better. Being able to confront the mistakes so publically, fess up to what went wrong, and then go at it again in completely new and different ways ensures we dig into the root causes and address those before iterating to the next stage.   
        <br /><br />
        Our mistakes in this market are ultimately what point the way to the best solutions— the solutions unshrouded by personal ego, cognitive dissonance or political bureaucracy. And it’s not just pointing the way to best solutions, but also just as much pointing the way so we can embrace the best versions of who we are and continually evolve to become. 
        <br /><br />
        In this dynamically occupied metaversal bazaar, our identities, self interest and self sovereignty are now directly under our own agency, instead of the centralised systems that don’t work or actively work against us to the benefit of the very few. Its this rightful ownership that allows us to start truly forging the narratives and stories that we want to be a part of and contribute to, that we are indespensible and consequential to.
