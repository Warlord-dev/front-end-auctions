        The floor price on some text generated NFTs i.e. literal EB Garamond text on the blockchain ... is what now?!!  
        <br /><br />
        The text isn’t actually the point though. And, if all you can see is the text, then you are missing the large bold subtext. What makes Loot so powerful is that there is almost no friction between it and the ability to mod it. Because essentially, modding is the fundamental practice that drives growth and change in fashion, gaming, mechanics… everything. In fact, the open metaverse is just one big giant mod with efficient interoperable connectors between all composable elements. The creative power, productive capacity and liquid vitality that we envision the metaverse to be immersed in can only be underwritten by modding. The methodology behind modding and the byproducts that come from it are what actually build the metaverse. And, not just build the metaverse but also ensure that it will be kept open, vital and continuously unique to each personal experience.

        Gatekeepers are all around us in web2. They feast on the assets that we take for granted, data from our self chosen identities and behaviours, while tempting us with a false lottery ticket that lures us deeper into the financial prisons that they’ve made smarter. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        A mod is about breaking down a whole into all of its parts, tweaking and messing around with the insides of those parts and then reassembling them into a novel, way cooler whole. 
        <br /><br />
        Mod culture and this practice of continually taking apart bigger components, breaking them down into base principles and their most modular building blocks means that each of us can gain something from this much broader range of objects, tools, functions than just what might be obvious from its face value.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a cultural identifier and clarion call for anyone eagerly looking for their opportunity to contribute to the broader infrastructure, content and communities that are forging the value for the digital and physical realms we are inhabiting. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        We have to smash through the deceptively convenient banality so lacking in originality that it lulls us to sleep. 
        <br /><br />
        The explosion of derivative projects built and being built around Loot infuse more color and variability for throwing countless sledge hammers at the big brother screen. It’s how we move from gatekeepers to gatemakers with the map, and room to play, so that we have hope of learning how to make gates instead of closing them.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        With that said, taking everything full circle, why Loot and what makes it special? It’s another step to ensuring that open access is at the heart of any ecosystem, community, economy or platform essential for the creation and exchange of value. In places where people connect and communicate there is no longer any justification for maintaining a clumsy overly burdensome walled garden approach.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        Loot gives people this opportunity with a mod of text that they can truly own and then use to build a wonderous emporium around them and others. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        We are at a critical stage where the nascent tools that hold the key to a more human centered life can easily be wrecked or stolen right from under us if we don’t act now. This time, we can mod our way there.
