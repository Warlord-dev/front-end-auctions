        LOOK: A Fashion Derivative of Loot Project

      <div className={styles.text8}>
        Interoperable metaverse fashion means that it is persistent across all multi-layered digital and physical realms. It is not a seperate layer to how we can express ourselves but rather just an extension of it and the tools we used to interact with the world around us.

        Fashion isn’t “fashion” anymore. It’s so much more. And on-chain fashion means that we can leverage the core features of the blockchain to create truly transformational wearables. A common, universal and transparent ledger means that, in a sense, coordination is woven into the thread count. Designers from every part of the globe can engage in a larger number of smaller scale actions for social, creative and financial gain. The liquidity pools get so much deeper.
