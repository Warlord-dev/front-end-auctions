        The tweets we send out. The status messages and albums we put on Facebook. The professional way we handle ourselves on LinkedIn. For every platform a unique identity, for every profile a unique persona.
        <br /><br />
        Our digital identities have become as complex as the different facets of our personality we portray on the internet, and have become as dynamic as the diverse digital platforms that we use. The pandemic only exacerbated our dependence on them – to the point where our digital identities have subsumed our physical ones.
        <br /><br />
        PFPs are becoming the avatar of choice for the crypto-centric users of Discord and Twitter – with NFTs as profile pictures becoming the norm for these platforms. They enable us to show the dynamic aspects of our character which we can curate ourselves. They have become the multipasses with which we navigate the vast expanses of the open metaverse. 
        <br /><br />
        And don’t look now, but NFT PFPs are starting to encroach the boundaries of LinkedIn. First and last names are starting to become passé in favor of Gutter Cats and Pudgy Penguins. From founders, devs, Google engineers, security practitioners, there’s a movement going on. It’s just an extension of how we have begun to take our online personas from one platform to the next. 
        <br /><br />
        PFPs not only fulfill the need for identity, self-expression, and the need to belong to a community. And now that we’ve just started to live the majority of our lives online, it makes perfect sense for us to search out our kinfolk in the metaverse. Not just a group you can shoot the shit with on Discord, but to make real, lasting, and worthwhile connections that expands our horizons, increases our connections, and creates value and wealth for all of us.
        <br /><br />
        NFT avatars are the modern-day social media checkmark. We may as well get used to it.
        <br /><br />
        Do you have your multipass yet?

        Starting in Web3 inspired this decentralized approach to digital identity — blockchain-based public-private key cryptography over passwords. 
        <br /><br />
        Magic is focused on future-proof authentication. Creating a passwordless future is a necessary first step as authentication cannot be future-proof without it.
        <br /><br />
        Passwords are obsolete and inherently flawed as an authentication method. The average internet user is expected to remember over 100 passwords, and as a result, a whopping 59% of people reuse their passwords across services. At this point, global data breaches are all-too-familiar headlines. 
        <br /><br />
        The risks of passwords compound as many centralized identity providers authenticate for users. Digital identities are therefore tied to and controlled by a handful of Big Tech companies, making lock-in for businesses, developers, and end-users even more problematic.
        <br /><br />
        Our team is passionate about solving this problem at its root in order to safeguard the trust between users and digital services.
        <br /><br />
        Essentially, our vision is to become the passport of the internet. 
        <br /><br />
        We want to bring self-sovereignty to internet users without reliance on Big Tech.
      </div>

        Our goal is to grow and scale with developers. We designed our business around this goal. The model factors in fair pricing and charging only based on usage. 
        <br /><br />
        Regarding authentication costs, it comes down to how much you need. For example, do you need more security protection plans such as smart session management, action-based permissions, multi factor? Possibly needing all those may result in high costs. 
        <br /><br />
        We want to be super developer-friendly across the product experience, as well as pricing. Originally we had first introduced monthly subscription plans, though from questions and feedback, we learned we needed to iterate on pricing. Now, our pay as you go pricing makes costs crystal clear, is flexible (no vendor lock-in), and helps developers and teams get up and running with 10,000 free logins. We’re happy that the feedback from customers has been overwhelmingly positive with this simple pricing model.
        <br /><br />
        Unlike other authentication providers where they package many features (when you may not need all) into one, we give flexibility for developers to only pay for what they use.

      <div className={styles.text4}>
        When it comes to a metaverse, the entry point — in other words, authentication — should be a common interface where everyone should be able to participate. That means being able to log in with your wallet by signing a message that proves your wallet’s key ownership. The interface will exist in multiple forms whether that be via your mobile device, computer, VR device, or other types of hardware devices. In terms of it being automatic, I am not sure. The real question is which world will we be treating as the real world? I would bet on the metaverse.

      <div className={styles.text5}>
        Our Web2 and Web3 authentication magic links are the same, the difference is how our business customers use Magic. Currently, Web2 businesses use Magic for passwordless authentication, while Web3 businesses use Magic for authentication and key management in order to be able to interact with various blockchains.
        <br /><br />
        What is most promising for the future of a user-owned and secured digital identity is portability. Digital identity can be represented in multiple forms whether that be a wallet address, name service, smart contract wallet, or NFT. In the end, it boils down to the common denominator which is a public/private key pair. This allows your identity to be portable, where if you happen to be not satisfied with platforms such as Facebook, you have the freedom to port your identity with data tied to it to another platform of your choice.

        Personal security is measured by impact. In the same way checking or freezing your credit protects financial consumers from imposter loans, masking your browser signature through privacy-focused browsers makes you a harder target to track.
        <br /><br />
        Consider a split between your work accounts, sensitive personal, and low stakes personal identities. Be open but aware on the majority of sites, and consider "cautious mode" when banking, accessing medical content, or exchanging sensitive correspondence.
        <br /><br />
        Facebook’s most recent data breach compromised phone numbers and personal data, which makes it easier for hackers to impersonate users and scam them into handing over login credentials. Over 500 million users’ data were leaked. As impersonation is in the hands of hackers, it raises the urgent need to upgrade and redefine what digital identity actually means.
        <br /><br />
        Platforms that tie your identity to your data don't want users to ever be signed out. Any company that tries to say "look, there you are!" instead of asking "who is there?" is in the business of surveillance, not authentication.
      </div>

        Magic is a one-stop shop for all authentication options whether that be email, social logins, Webauthn, or SMS and multi-factor authentication coming soon. The beauty is that we abstract away all of the complexities and provide developers with a plug and play SDK.
        <br /><br />
        As developers, we’ve experienced the challenges building secure, compliant, and scalable user authentication first-hand. Every team building an application needs to solve for auth, and rolling your own auth is incredibly difficult — given all the overhead and risk involved with security and privacy compliance, scalability and reliability, and so on. 
        <br /><br />
        Our aim is to empower developers and make it easy to implement future-proof login for users. With just a few lines of code, developers can add a variety of passwordless login methods in minutes and easily customize the user-friendly login experience. Magic plays nicely with the broader low-code/no-code trend. 
        <br /><br />
        It’s an amazing thing to be able to free time up for teams of all sizes and enable them to launch and grow faster.
        <br /><br />
        We also help developers improve conversion rates on the onboarding flow. We spend a lot of time and effort optimizing for conversion rate at each step. It’s super exciting when customers share these wins; one customer told us conversion rate skyrocketed to over 90%. We’re energized to help more and more customers across Web2 and Web3 all around the world.
        <br /><br />
        As far as what other platforms can learn from Magic, we’ll leave that up to folks to share that with us! Right now, we’re laser-focused on taking care of our customers — including exciting names in the NFT world like Nifty’s, Wolfram Afra NFT Auction, Async Art — and continually advancing our product and technology for developers and end-users alike.
