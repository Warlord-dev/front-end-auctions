        E-SPORTS RISING STAR OF THE MONTH

      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Plopski is a 19 year old Swedish-Spanish CSGO player and has already competed professionally in over 60 tournaments. He is currently playing for Ninjas in Pyjamas as a rifler. Plopski’s family history in gaming goes back to the roots, where his dad was previously also a CSGO player and has been his biggest supporter since, instilling a strong work ethic into Plopski, that is shown through his willingness to maintain as a student of the game and put in the hours necessary to improve his craft— killstreaks and more.

        CEB is all about Dota2, currently playing for OG. His professional career started all the way back in 2011, and over the length of his time in the spotlight he’s certainly experienced both the highs and lows of the industry; from the 2012 International collapse to reaching coach level at OG. His resiliance is a testament to all, as he continues to prove the haters wrong and remove all doubt that any of his skills have suffered decay.

        BYBIT EXCHANGE SIGNS EXPOSRTS DEAL
        <br /><br /><br />
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text14}>
        After a delayed launch, it’s safe to say that crypto x gaming is finally seeing the dawn of the recognition that it deserves. And casual gaming through Play-to-Earn models only scratches the surface of just how much value can be brought to the gaming industry through the direct connectivity of NFTs, DeFi and other crypto powered tools. Esports is another huge untapped sector for building wealth catalysts that can transform the entire top down approach that the current model is locked within— bridging stronger access channels so that any passionate player willing to put in the effort can have a fair shot at a player’s chair. 
        <br /><br />
        Bybit crypto exchange is making further moves into the esports world, starting with partnerships with esports organizations Astralis and Alliance. Here, they plan to expand their player engagement strategy that are inclusive of financial education programs— esports yield farming might not be that far away.

        Le Mans Virtual Series LAUNCH
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text16}>
        Motorsport Games and the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO) have joined forces to launch the Le Mans Virtual Series with a $250,000 prize pool. It’s another bullish sign for the adoption of digital motorsports racing, where sponsors for the series include that of Goodyear, Thrustmaster, Rolex and Total Energies. Who knows when we will see  F1 Monte Carlo racecd in VR, my bet is that it will be much sooner than one might initially expect. As more liquidity pours into virtual racing, more of us will start to recognise that immersives tracks don’t have a speed limit or set DRS zones.
