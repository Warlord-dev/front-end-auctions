        static plane where so much valuable energy dissipates, now, the work done is more efficiently retained and then put to beneficial use.

        That’s one of the many reasons why Fractional Garment Ownership (FGO) is such an important underpinning for the entire web3 fashion industry. It’s how we keep every stage of the supply chain and production process injected with flexible and interchangeable sub component modules of promiscuous prosperity.

        So what should you do with your LOOK? Well, it’s more about what can you do? Ultimately, what LOOK does is bring the power of capital and code into what previously was just a bundle of words. The idea that you can do anything that you set your mind to, was just that; fancy words promoting an idea. 
        <br /><br />
        With composable programmability, this idea can materialise. Literally. Because as you create with these NFT enshrined words, the garments, derivatives and re-interpretations that you make become gathering points for attention, capital and market interest.

        Wear without permission. That’s web3 fashion.
