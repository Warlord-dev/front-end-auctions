        A Mindset for the Metaverse
      </h3>
      <p className={styles.firstText}>
        The concept of the "metaverse" has been used in countless sci-fi tropes (most notably Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash) before the term caught on, and its nebulous definitions have gone beyond the realm of gaming with which it is inextricably intertwined.
        <br /><br />
        The tantalizing prospect of living in a virtual world unbound by the constraints of the all-too-mundane reality of the material world is now coming to pass, and it's no longer restricted to a subset of the population immersed in these extended realities — gamers.
        <br /><br />
        Perhaps venture capitalist Matthew Ball put it best when he stated that the metaverse "isn't a game, a piece of hardware, or an online experience." Instead, it's a successor to the internet that features as many protocols, technologies, devices, languages, content, and immersive user experiences driven by gaming, social media, and the ever-increasing shift towards a fully digital economy.
        <br /><br />
        One thing's for sure: the metaverse will continue to defy conventional definitions as it constantly evolves. And, as the pieces all fall into place at a frighteningly rapid pace (thanks to the coronavirus pandemic), there is a massive need for the millions upon millions of individuals to adapt to living in these limitless virtual universes as they come to life. Thus, we need a blueprint for living in the metaverse.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.secondText}>
        After all, the metaverse is the future, the metaverse is here, and metaverse is here to stay. So long as the metaverse's future remains uncertain and its evolution constant, we may as well learn how to adapt, learn the language, and integrate to the culture of the virtual worlds none of us are genuinely native in.

        <span>The Importance of "Mental Stimulation" </span>
        <br />
        Americans aren't big on thinking about the future. A survey conducted by the Institute for the Future showed that Americans barely think of the future five years from now and onwards. This is symptomatic of the so-called future gap — a gap that leads to impulsive and antisocial behavior.
        <br /><br />
        Anyone can be an armchair quarterback when hindsight is 20/20. But it's fascinating to think about how different the global response to COVID might have been if we'd asked the same questions about dealing with a similar pandemic five or ten years ago. The same is true if we had confronted the question of how social media and memes could be weaponized to disinform masses and influence election outcomes earlier than we did as a society.
        <br /><br />
        Therefore, there is a need to reassess and think more deliberately about the future as it emerges in the metaverse to be better trained to solve problems and identify meaningful trends in it, especially considering its massive potential to redefine society as we know it. 
        <br /><br />
        But before anyone dismisses the value of being curious about the future as mere mental stimulation, it's important to note that spotting trends and leveraging them is critical if we wish to create meaningful, tangible, and long-term changes in our lives. The same is true if we want to do the same for the dynamic physical and digital realms we inhabit. As futurist entrepreneur and author Rohit Bhargava puts it, the future belongs to those who can see what others don't.

        <span>Free Your Mind</span><br/>
        The ability to think like a futurist is essential to living in the metaverse as it unfolds, especially because literally anything and everything in the digital realms can be worlds away from how we've experienced life thus far — and we're fast accelerating this digital transformation.
        <br/><br/>
        Keeping an open mind to the possibilities of a dynamic environment is something that futurists have done for ages, and that's the same mindset that immigrants to the metaverse —all of us ­­— need.
        <br/><br/>
        Game designer, author, and futurist extraordinaire Jane McGonigal stated that it's all a matter of detaching yourself from your ideas of what you believe is possible. This is possible by looking for evidence that everything is subject to change — even something that has been accepted as gospel truth for millennia. Like McGonigal's future, the metaverse is a place where everything is literally and figuratively different, so the same futuristic and open mindset is a prerequisite in the latter. Once our minds are removed from the constraints of what we think is possible, we can then believe in creative, alternative, and equally favorable outcomes.
        <br/><br/>
        McGonigal, who teaches a class on futurist thinking at Stanford University, provided three concrete exercises on how to think like one:
        <br/><br/>
        <span>Predicting the past.</span> <br/>
        Predicting historical events sounds like an oxymoron (if not contradictory), but understanding the past helps individuals detect patterns. Moreover, it helps us understand that the future isn't cut and dried yet — we all have the agency to reimagine the outcomes of our actions had we made a different decision in a particular situation. Ask yourself how another course of action might have led to a different future.
        <br/><br/>
        <span>Recalling the future.</span> <br/>
        Remembering future events is akin to visualizing a future scenario wherein you achieve the desired outcome. From there, you would then need to explain how you reached the said outcome. Doing so trains your mind to believe that the desired result is more likely to occur because your brain has taken a picture of that scenario.
        <br/><br/>
        <span>Practicing "hard" empathy.</span> <br/>
        Hard empathy is putting yourself through a totally unfamiliar experience. Put yourself in the shoes of a total stranger from a country you've never heard before. How would they react to a particular situation? How would they live through a specific reality? By completely divorcing ourselves from our all-consuming solipsism and empathizing with another, we can glean new insights from another point of view.
