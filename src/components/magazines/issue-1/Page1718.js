        But those in opposition to UBI are quick to point out that it will increase tax collection, which can trigger higher inflation. When that happens, commodity prices go up, and the buying power decreases, if not withers. However, there are instances wherein gloom instead of doom occurred with UBI. In 2011, Kuwait provided $4,000 to every citizen despite experiencing high inflation. Contrary to fearful belief, the country’s inflation rate decreased to under four percent after the universal income.
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, Alaska has had some semblance of basic income since 1982. Before the first release, the state had a higher inflation rate than the rest of the United States. But as the dividends started, Alaska had lower inflation than the other 50 states combined. Dauphin town in Canada eliminated poverty in five years through a universal income. There were also UBI experiments in Namibia, India, Finland, and Canada.
        <br /><br />
        The stimulus checks from the United States government are also an iteration of universal basic income. Meanwhile, the first check was for a maximum of $1,200 with an additional $500 per dependent. Stimulus check number two was worth $600 per person with another $600 per qualifying child. But given that economic recovery is not an overnight result, US President Joe Biden is also proposing to continue issuing checks worth $300 per child for 12 months.

        While the plan looks promising, the distribution of the checks is ripe with concerns. Identifying the rightful number of recipients might be challenging without an updated list of residents in an area. Likewise, releasing it through a government agency adds another gateway FOR distribution delays. Crowds will also gather at check releasing sites, making it contradicting to social distancing guidelines.

        Distributing through bank accounts poses some problems because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation revealed that 7.1 million American households do not have a single bank account. If a beneficiaries list depends on that alone, some rightful recipients will not receive much-needed assistance.

        <span>UBI in Blockchain</span><br />
        The emergence of global blockchain networks bolstered UBI’s viability through creating new and accessible financial applications that are available online. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can bypass the roadblocks that traditional banking systems establish to safeguard their policies. Blockchain can compensate for what these institutions lack, and there are three blockchain UBI’s worth mentioning.
        <br /><br />
        First is Circles which depends on individualized cryptocurrencies, which involves a social graph of trust. Those cryptocurrencies get minted regularly to create a monetary fabric that will work as a Universal Basic Income. A smart contract assigns a Personal Currency to every new blockchain account. Likewise, they have an annual inflation schedule to foster spending and to prohibit hoarding.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.section4}>
        All currencies are under the governance of a unified set of rules, and they continue to create new coins at the same rate to maintain equal distribution to all members. But to produce money, Circles users must trust other currencies or validate the identity of other users. This trust determines that the virtual coin is legitimate and that it is up for regular disbursement.
        <br /><br />
        Second, social trading platform eToro initiated the GoodDollar, which provides $G stablecoins daily to registered users. Donations fund this non-profit project. Supporters deposit their assets before yield farming on decentralized finance protocols like Aave or Compound. Users receive some of the interest while another portion of it becomes collateral for new $G coins.
        <br /><br />
        Initially, DAI backed the $G stablecoins. Eventually, GoodDollar will diversify to other cryptocurrencies. As of December 2020, 40,000 users from 180 countries signed up for the project, most of which are from developing countries wherein income inequality and low wages are rampant.
        <br /><br />
        From all the donated DAI, its interest rate will correspond to a certain number of $G coins. Divide that figure with the number of days in a year, and that’s the daily allowance each user will receive. Out of the total users, close to half remain engaged with the platform. An average of 13,000 users engage on the GoodDollar Marketplace on Facebook to signal a thriving economic alternative.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, the UBI token uses Kleros’ Proof of Humanity, which uses video submission to verify users. The POH aims to prevent Sybil attacks wherein a system becomes vulnerable through multiple identities. Without stringent verification, attackers can create bogus accounts to disrupt the UBI coin. The process uses reverse Turing tests to determine whether a registered user is real or dicey.
