        <div className={styles.textTitle}>ELASTICDAO</div>
        <br />A platform to manage decentralised organisations and make governance fairer. Projects
        will be able to launch their DAOs and governance tokens through the platform where
        ElasticDAO’s solution to governance achieves three main goals; whale proof, free-rider
        proof, and it is very much a “skin in the game” approach where token holders are directly
        incentivised to participate and contribute to the project’s success. It’s a super innovative
        approach that manages to solve some of the biggest issues in project governance, while still
        being a great profitable investment for active governance participants. $EGT tokens are
        directly backed by the projects ETH treasury, allowing anyone to exit by redeeming and
        burning their $EGT in exchange for their share in the $ETH treasury. This not only
        incentivises voters to only vote for expenses that will be beneficial and bring value to the
        project over the long term, since these expenses will be taking $ETH out of the treasury and
        decreasing the amounts backing each $EGT. But, also, in the case of an attempted hostile
        take-over by whales buying a large part of the supply to take control of governance, token
        holders will always be able to redeem/burn their tokens and exit with their share of the
        treasury as a last line of defense.

        <div className={styles.textTitle}>PUSH PROTOCOL</div>
        <br />
        The first ‘Ethereum Push Notification Service’ (EPNS)— a decentralised notification protocol
        that enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications directly from decentralised
        or centralised services in a privacy preserving manner. Today, communication between web3
        providers and consumers often occurs through email, social media, Telegram, etc. This
        defeats the purpose of web3, as it depends on centralised providers and sacrifices user
        privacy, especially for communications specific to the users’ wallets. And to preserve
        decentralisation and privacy, major DeFi platforms don’t even have user logins or
        notifications. So today if a loan is liquidated on Aave or Compound, there is no way to
        notify the wallet owner. Users need to actively monitor their wallets for such events. EPNS
        solves all of this. And, their integration of IPFS means notifications can include not only
        text, but also images, audio and video. Some possible notification types; wallet crypto
        movement tracker, ENS domain expiry, loan liquidation alert, limit order triggered on DEX,
        communication of urgent information to token holders (protocol exploit, token swap
        deadlines, etc).

        <div className={styles.textTitle}>M!XSOM3</div>
        <br />A DeFi strategy aggregator that allows the execution of a collection of DeFi
        strategies (“flows”) by wrapping up multiple transactions into a joint transaction that is
        then executed by a single smart contract. And, it’s built on xDAI for greater sustainability
        in transaction costs and speed— a strategy that would usually involve 3 or 4 gas hungry txs
        on ETH L1, will now involve two simpler bridging txs (to get in and out of the xDAI
        sidechain) and all the remaining complex txs will happen on xDAI. An example of DeFi Flow
        would be: swap ETH for DAI -&gt; deposit DAI into Curve to get yCRV -&gt; deposit yCRV into yearn
        to get yUSD. Doing all this in a single, low-fee wrapped tx will not only save a lot of gas
        fees, but will also make the whole process a lot more user friendly. Imagine showing a
        no-coiner friend that they can go from fiat to USD stablecoins on curve/yearn earning
        15%-20% APYs with a few clicks, and without ever needing to get exposure to more volatile
        crypto assets!? This is how we get the next wave of #DeFi adoption.

      <div className={styles.rightText}>HYPERREAALIYAH</div>
            
      <div className={styles.rightText1}>
        <a href='http://hyperreaaliyah.com/' target='_blank'>HYPERREAALIYAH</a> was founded in 2014 through a process 
        that involved the writings of Jean Baudrillard, 
        one (1) BTC worth of acid in the day’s exchange rate, and a handful of people. Since then, 
        HYPERREAALIYAH has existed as a simulation of an artist, 
        born again for each new project through the collaborators of that project. 
        Sometimes for clarity HYPERREAALIYAH is referred to as a collective, 
        yet it has no formal membership and only becomes realised through projects for which a new team is always formed. 
        Both professional artists and non-artists have participated in the production of works of HYPERREAALIYAH.
        <br /><br />
        Since its inception, HYPERREAALIYAH has considered everything in existence as material to be moulded into new forms. 
        This creative process has embodied a commentary on the structure of mediated reality as a surface 
        which can be used to create new meaning although it is sometimes controlled by copyrights and trademarks. 
        HYPERREAALIYAH’s argument has been that if the meaning of a work that uses existing material is new or, say, original, 
        the material loses its meaning and gains a new one. 
        <br /><br />
        The name HYPERREAALIYAH consists of two parts; (1) hyperreal which translates to more real than real. 
        This is a category often experienced in a mediated world where the representation becomes experienced as more real 
        than the original. For example, a news story about a hurricane on the other side of the globe is more real to its reader 
        than the hurricane itself; and (2) aaliyah which is a judaic concept meaning a return to the holy land. Thus, 
        HYPERREAALIYAH becomes a more real than real return to the holy lands of, in this case, meaning.
        <br /><br />
        The premise for HYPERREAALIYAH, the reason for its existence is the argument 
        that as hyperreality has become an everyday phenomenon, we are all in diaspora from meaning. 
        HYPERREAALIYAH is always looking for new ways to return to meaning, yet never quite seems to get there.

      <div className={styles.rightText2}>HYPERREAALIYAH’s First NFT Series</div>
      <div className={styles.rightText3}>
        This NFT drop is unlockable <a href="/unlockable" target='_blank'>here</a> and was created during the congregation of HYPERREAALIYAH in early May, 2021, in and around Helsinki, Finland.  We minted these pieces on the Day of Ascension with the help of Digitalax in Silicon Valley, US. This collaboration is thanks to the initiative and vision of Emma-Jane MacKinnon-Lee who we owe all the kudos.

        <span>Genesis Objects: Astral Travels Special Edition</span><br />
        The series consists of three multimedia 3d objects existing in various modes of rarity. The so-called common object is a wearable ring that we've named Trivial Perseption. The semi-rare object is a digitally kinetic sculpture called Bodysattvax. The rarest object is Allegory of Meta, which is an unnatural formation from a beach of your dreams with a video and sound emitting and floating crystal inside. 
        <br /><br />
        The rarest form of this series is a participatory performance called Joint Paean by Jenna Jauhiainen where they will join you inside Allegory of Meta for a discussion about hopes and dreams related to transitioning from web2 to web3. This performance includes a homage to the floating crystal with a specially choreographed dance. 
        <br /><br />
        Most of the visual and sound material attributed to these objects is derived from existing material, yet the shape of each object is unique. Among other things, the objects include trademarked and copyrighted colors, logos, images, songs and videos. The three objects all have a common source of origin that will be revealed in 40 months, approximately 3,3 years. In the meantime, we will be upgrading the objects as to their compatibility and interoperability aspects, perfecting these pieces until the final revelation of their source.

        The Allegory of Meta is an unnatural formation, created as a space to spend time in pondering, dancing, holding out the rain or perhaps inhabiting it as a caveperson of the metaverse. It alludes to Plato's cave in embodying an unreal reality, with shadows and reflections with only a transitory relation to the real. On its surface, Allegory of Meta is embedded with a unique texture made out of copyrighted and trademarked colors, logos and 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.rightText7}>
        images. Inside the formation a floating, video displaying crystal emits a soundscape inspired by the forever rising, never dropping glory. Outside, the soundscape is calm like a sea-breeze. The owners of Allegory of Meta can unlock an ultra-rare feature where the artist and researcher Jenna Jauhiainen will join them inside the formation placed in the virtual environment of their choosing. The performance includes a discussion about hopes and dreams related to transitioning from web2 to web3, and a homage to the floating crystal with a specially choreographed dance. The details of the performance are negotiated with the owner of this ultra-rare NFT. For example, it is possible to enjoy this performance as a one-on-one encounter or invite an audience to join.

      <div className={styles.rightText9}>
        The Bodysattvax is a statue, a totem for XD, the international symbol of ecstatic laughter. This statue pays homage to mediatization, to hyperreality and simulacrum. Bodysattvax can be placed inside or outside, creating a tranquil yet tense ambience with shivers of shock and awe. The video on the background is what's embedded into the statue's texture. The soundscape emitted by Bodysattvax is inspired by MGS2 which explores themes such as memetics, social engineering, existentialism, postmodernism, virtual reality and the internal struggle of political liberty and freedom of thought.

      <div className={styles.rightText10}>
        The Trivial Perseption is a ring is inspired by the treacherous wallflowerness of random elements around us, the kind with apparent naturalness to the sensory overload they cause and contextual burden they carry. The video you see on the background of the ring is what's embedded into the ring's texture. The soundscape emitted by the forever orbiting and pulsating glass jewel is inspired by Sting suing Juice WRLD and Metallica ruining Napster.
