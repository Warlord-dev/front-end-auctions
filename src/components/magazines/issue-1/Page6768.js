        The modding community is the backbone to the gaming and esports industries. The modders have
        built the castles for the OG game content that so many of us identify with, supporting
        increasingly novel content for building avid player bases and die hard fans. The community
        is heavily undervalued, unseen.

        DARK PRINCE has been an integral part of the modding community for a number of years. He
        identified with mod culture after being introduced to the vibrant Devil May Cry modding
        scene. Since then, he has become one of the most inspiring, humble and well known voices in
        the DMC community. He mods because he has a true passion and wants to bring joy to others
        through his content.
        <br />
        <br />
        When first meeting Dark Prince in the devilmaycry.org forum he was so welcoming— decoding
        the ins and outs of the ecosystem and openly sharing his journey as a modder.

      <div className={styles.text3}>How long have you been a gamer for?</div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        I can't remember exactly how long, but, I can guess that I was around 4 or 5 (God knows my
        memories). I played classic Sega games. Then back when I was around 6-7 or 8 (my memory is
        still foggy) I was playing interesting “brick” games before becoming a PC gamer from XP
        between 8 and 10 and yeah I was also a bit of a mobile gamer.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>What is your favorite game?</div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        I love DMC (Vergil), Marvel stuff (Spider-Man & Venom) and Shadow of Mordor/War (Badass Elf
        Lord Celebrimbor). I would like to see Spider-Man again on PC.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        What was the first game that you ever modded? Why did you choose this game?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        From what I can remember I always played games without mods and I wasn’t even aware that
        there was a modding community out there! But, after installing DMC I suddenly became more
        curious in modding scene, and the rest was history... I started my hobby as a modder.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text9}>What drew you into modding & becoming a game modder?</div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        I'm not a “special person” or anything but when I came across the modding community I
        realised that this is a place where I can really let my imagination run wild. There truly
        are no limits. You inspire the narrative.

        Spider-Man games finally have more suits! A version of a game can have exclusive content
        that isn’t originally provided to PC players! With mods, PC players can experience the same
        content as exclusive players of the same platform— Marvel Ultimate Alliance can be
        remastered with mods to the latest version. It’s pretty amazing.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        Do you have any opinions about the future of modding? Do you think larger developers/game
        studios will shut down the modding communities and industry?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text12}>
        They simply can not shut our community down..
        <br />
        <br />
        Some game companies don't like their games get modded, they prefer to maintain complete
        control, keep everything behind a walled garden. But, modding is what keeps the game
        industry alive. It is what gives the devs and studios huge benefits, it’s what ensures that
        their games don’t die!
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        What is your advice to people wanting to start modding? Where should they go? Where do they
        start learning?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text14}>
        Modding is not an exclusive talent, anyone can become modder. The best place to start is
        join a community (Like devilmaycry.org !)... watch some youtube tutorials and take advice
        from others. Modding communities are incredibly active on forums and discord servers. Just
        dive in and start, it really is one of the most vibrant ecosystems, and, even if you don’t
        want to actually develop a mod, I can assure you that the gameplay is just as fun, so..
        start by just playing, support other modders work!
