        And, as the internet moves towards an open, trustless, and permissionless model — a prelude
        to the eventual decentralization of the internet as we know it, one driven by blockchain
        protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum — we see the next logical step towards the evolution of
        the metaverse.
        <br />
        <br />
        An internet that's not bound by the whims and caprices of large, centralized corporations
        and platform owners like Facebook, Apple, or Google, which store massive amounts of
        information about you and me that they use to sell us things and influence us for the
        benefit of their almighty advertisers. All with no seeming consequences for their
        negligence, misconduct, or wrongdoing.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's not to mention the ever-growing file they build on each of us with every piece of
        personal information we willingly surrender to them in favor of the value of the services
        that they provide — subjecting ourselves to draconian terms and conditions that, with one
        wrong move, can lead to the social media equivalent of damnatio memoriae.
        <br />
        <br />
        We've seen how Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube can Thanos-snap even the most popular of
        accounts for a single faux pas (or by coordinated mass reporting), whether substantiated or
        otherwise — taking every photo, video, story, post, or piece of content along with them.
        Every single hour spent crafting content.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.secondParagraph} />
      <div className={styles.secondText}>
        But imagine if there was a way to keep every single piece of content you've created
        regardless of whatever platform you have it on and be able to move it fluently from one 3D
        environment to another without any technical restraints? What if there was a way to go
        beyond the walled gardens that prevent connectivity between different content that Big Tech
        has so skillfully built to lock users into their dystopian ecosystems?
        <br />
        <br />
        Pretty soon, the days of Facebook, Apple, and Google owning every single piece of your
        digital life will be no longer a thing. Rather, you own your online presence — and
        everything that goes with it. The emergence of Web3 will change the way we think about the
        ownership of our digital lives. And NFTs are the key to this new standard of ownership.
        <br />
        <br />
        NFTs prove this immutable ownership over your digital assets, including your avatar. And
        while we can all debate endlessly on how NFTs might or might not be under a bubble, one
        thing's for sure: the technology is not going anywhere as the metaverse takes shape along
        with Web3. And as avatars are literally our digital representations, it makes perfect sense
        to own them alongside the other digital assets that we own instead of leaving them at the
        mercy of an absentee landlord.
        <br />
        <br />
        Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney has become one of the leading figures for the metaverse,
        taking the fight against the walled gardens that prevent it from fully blooming. Closed
        systems are the norm, thus leading to less competition at every point in the value chain.
        Apart from that, there are no technical interoperability standards, and you can't move from
        one environment to another.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.thirdParagraph} />
      <div className={styles.thirdText}>
        The metaverse needs to be an open, live, evolving platform with builders creating worlds of
        all kinds that are interoperable and interact with each other. A blockchain-based foundation
        for an open metaverse is the apparent path towards a long-term open framework Sweeney is
        advocating for — one that's free from any gatekeeping, and every actor has their agency. And
        NFTs will be the bedrock of that metaverse. The technology is already here, and it's not
        going away anytime soon.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sweeney advocates for a shardless environment enabling virtual content environments to scale
        to massive sizes without the closed approach that creates broken rather than immersive
        experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        His advocacy has led him to take Apple head on in response to a series of events that led to
        Epic Games filing an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant. TL;DR: Epic implemented its
        own payment system on iOS to circumvent Apple's charges, which was against App Store rules.
        In response, Apple took down Epic's apps, including Fortnite.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.rightFirstParagraph} />
      <div className={styles.rightFirstText}>
        The outcome will determine whether Fortnite will ever make a comeback to iOS devices,
        whether Epic can continue to access the Unreal Engine on iOS platforms, and lastly, whether
        third-party app stores can launch on iOS devices or otherwise. If Epic can prove Apple's
        monopoly, any game publisher can create their app store on iOS devices, opening the door for
        games to be playable on iOS.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.rightSecondParagraph} />
      <div className={styles.rightSecondText}>
        The heat is on as industry secrets are about to be dragged out in the public arena —
        something Apple keeps under close lock and key. The trial is shaping up to be an opportunity
        to get a rare look at Apple’s walled garden and the magic that happens behind it. The main
        point of contention is the inherent 70%-30% revenue scheme on the App Store, with Apple
        obviously taking the lion’s share of the profits. Epic is framing that arrangement as unfair
        and one-sided, while Apple has been painting the latter as a disingenuous, avaricious
        partner — as the tech giant faces its biggest legal threat in recent memory.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s going to be a tooth and nail fight that may change the way the gaming industry — and in
        the bigger picture — how the metaverse evolves, and we should be paying more attention to
        this skirmish because of the far-ranging consequences it poses for the fledgling layer of
        reality that’s emerging right beneath our collective noses.
        <br />
        <br />
        We can all chalk it up to the growing pains of the metaverse — Sweeney's stand against the
        walled gardens exemplified by the fight against Apple is just what we need to plot out the
        future of the metaverse and progress to the next stage of the paradigm shift. Are we going
        to see a dramatic rearranging of the metaverse’s cosmology? Time will tell. Sooner or later.
