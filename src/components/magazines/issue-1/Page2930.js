        Fashion is Evolving Towards Extended Reality — And That's a Good Thing
      </h2>
      <p className={styles.section1}>
        The coronavirus pandemic has gone from conquest to conquest, leaving entire industries devastated in its wake and forcing them to rethink their position in the "new normal" we've all been forced to accept. A new normal rife with lockdowns, flight restrictions, store closures, social distancing, and global disruption on a scale we haven't experienced as a species since World War II.
        <br /><br />
        For better or worse, COVID-19 became the catalyst for widespread acceleration across all aspects of commerce, and the trillion-dollar fashion industry is no exception.
        <br /><br />
        After all, the only constant thing in the physical world we live in is change — and the truth is, the fashion industry hasn't changed much since the early aughts.
        <br /><br />
        If there's anything the industry ever taught us, it is this: nothing is too big to fail. And no industry is resistant to change.
        <br /><br />
        The fashion industry's major retailers are losing their grip on the industry. On the other hand, e-commerce is booming as physical stores and showrooms, fast-fashion or haute couture notwithstanding, have faced scores of shutdowns worldwide. Employees across the supply chain have been furloughed or laid off. Meanwhile, everyone, including their grandmother — and that's not an understatement — has literally had to move their lives online. 
        
      </p>
      <p className={styles.section2}>
        We're in the midst of a full-blown fashion revolution. And the emergence of several immersive technologies representing the vast realities in virtual environments that come in all sorts of acronyms is proof positive of this ongoing transformation: virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), which brands have employed to create bespoke customer experiences that their physical stores used to deliver, as well as mixed reality (MR), which combines both elements of the latter.
        <br /><br />
        AR, VR, and MR are categorized under the broader, more normie-friendly term comprising all three realities: extended reality, or XR — creating experiences wherein users themselves can bring digital assets into the physical realm and allow them to bring physical items into the digital realms.
        <br /><br />
        Extended reality is essentially another manifestation of the metaverse — the apotheosis of all virtual worlds, iterations of immersive realities, and the ever-growing internet.
        <br /><br />
        While fashion brands have been taking notice of the growing impact that XR has on consumer behavior even before the pandemic broke out, the acceleration towards the use of novel, advanced digital solutions, and platforms to distinguish themselves online. The field is heating up as XR is set to become an $80 billion market by 2025, and the applications for fashion are immense — and so is the potential for it to take over the fashion value chain. 
      </p>
      <p className={styles.section3}>
        As more and more labels and startups ride the hype train and attempt to bring high-end fashion into extended reality and the metaverse, digital transformation and innovation are constant.
        <br /><br />
        Coperni goes XR<br />
        Case in point: Parisian fashion label Coperni recently launched its S/S 2021 collection entitled "Ready to Care," and its campaign was representative of how fashion and technology are constantly pushing the envelope for brands that do care to make the transformation. Entirely produced by leveraging XR technology, the campaign featured dramatic, breathtaking visuals of a 3D urban metropolis incorporating elements from physical and digital reality, with vertiginous, spectacular cinematics mirroring the same fashion show they did on top of the Tour Montparnasse in Paris. Straight out of a video game, and fitting too, as Epic Games' Unreal Engine was among the XR technologies used to create the campaign's lush, intricate urban landscapes and cutting-edge video content.
        <br /><br />
        LVMH leverages the blockchain<br />
        Another potentially transformational technology brought on by this shift towards the boundless realms of extended reality is the rise of the blockchain in fashion, exemplified by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — and beyond the gaudy prices NFT art and digital real estate secured by NFTs fetch, luxury brands are harnessing the blockchain to create a platform that will verify the provenance and authenticity of their goods. 
        <br /><br />
        Legacy brands LVMH (parent organization of Louis Vuitton), Prada, and Richemont are partnering to realize those lofty goals by founding the Aura Blockchain Consortium — a platform with the ability to track luxury items with a unique digital identifier based on NFTs. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Aura will be able to trace the exact origins of each piece of material, creating a narrative and history of each individual item, apart from being able to track who is buying what at which point of sale, all the way to the secondary market.
        <br /><br />
        The immutability of ownership upheld by the blockchain makes counterfeiting ridiculously harder than it used to — when every piece of the breadcrumb trail is out there for all the world to see. Hublot, Bulgari and Louis Vuitton are already on Aura, and it's not hard to foresee other brands joining the platform in the near future as we pivot towards a digitalized industry with high customer expectations that demand the utmost transparency.
