        Sasmitha Janindu is an undergraduate in BA (hons) in Fashion Design, who aslo goes under the
        alias “Rudeolph”. She learned 3D software during the lockdown, exploring all kinds of visual
        techniques like that of creating virtual garments, surreal landscapes, simulations and
        simple animations. Most of her works are constructed with limited resources, limited
        computing power and limited knowledge of 3D software— her determination supersedes any
        supposed barriers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her advice; anyone can start in 3D. “There are numerous tutorials available online,
        basically for free which will teach you fundamentals of 3D graphics. The rest is only
        limited to your imagination and creativity.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Through 3D, Sasmitha discovered the NFT space, where she minted her genesis NFT on
        NFTshowroom, built on the HIVE blockchain. She also just launched on Foundation!
