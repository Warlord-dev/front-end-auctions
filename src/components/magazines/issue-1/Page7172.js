        GDP per capita ranking is no longer the gold standard of economic prosperity that we've all
        been led to believe it was. Instead, a population's well-being is just as important,
        particularly within the context of global crises that worsen economic inequality.
        <br />

        The metaverse, and gaming in general, are increasingly demonstrating their actual value as
        the digitalization of society accelerates. New, disruptive, and decentralized technologies
        are being developed at light speed, granting user agency on a scale that's never been seen
        before. The metaverse economy is constantly expanding as eye-watering sums of money are
        passed around like hot potatoes. We're seeing a shift towards individuals taking full
        ownership of their digital identities and controlling them as they move through their
        bespoke customer journeys interacting with the brands they choose while strengthening social
        bonds between fellow gamers and digital citizens. Creators, artists, designers, and
        visionary startups are finally getting their due as harbingers of a new era thanks to the
        metaverse.
        <br />
        <br />
        Moreover, as the lines blur between the physical and the digital planes of existence, the
        opportunities remain as tantalizing and limitless for creators of all persuasions as more
        companies involve themselves in the emergent metaverse, all seeking to get their piece of
        the pie (and digital real estate) on which to advertise, create, innovate, and explore.
        <br />
        <br />
        While McGonigal stated that reality was "broken" because it lacks the ability to engage or
        motivate meaningful action as games do (in the negative context of the word), the metaverse
        can be defined as "broken" within the context of an exceedingly over-powered or downright
        degenerate Magic: the Gathering card because its powers are so immense, and its impact can
        be world-changing.
        <br />
        <br />
        It's astounding to think that there are still individuals who feel the metaverse — and
        gaming, for that matter — exists solely for the purpose of tuning in, turning on, and
        dropping out. But the truth is, gaming is so much more than just hedonistic pleasure. Gaming
        has always been about creating a sense of identity and belonging to a tightly-knit
        community. It's all just a matter of putting it all together and leveraging the unbridled
        optimism, productivity, and creativity — as well as an epic win condition — to make real,
        tangible, and long-lasting change, regardless of what plane of existence it is pursued on,
        physical or digital notwithstanding.

        Hi! I am Arez, I am 22 year old artist and designer from Russia.
        <br />
        <br />I started making my first art in high school when I was drawing skins and weapon
        finishes for a CS:GO workshop.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over time as my interests expanded I started learning CS:GO modding, and eventually went
        into a design school, where I acquired most of my skills in graphic design, sketching, 3d
        modeling, animation and rendering.
        <br />
        <br />I now use this skillset to work on Parabellum, a project of my own, a game based on
        CS:GO. A Few years ago I became interested in abstract fine arts and paintings. This year I
        finished Union of Russian Abstractionists school and received a Kandinsky Medal.
        <br />
        <br />I like combining different skills in one artwork, rather than sticking to just one
        medium. I am currently working on my "X T R O P Y" art project, which is focused on the
        power of red light and color. My rule is that if it exists, you can make art with it."
