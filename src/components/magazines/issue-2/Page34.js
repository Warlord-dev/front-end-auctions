      <h1>Reclaiming the Delta.</h1>
      <p className={styles.content}>
        Why do we accept things as they are?
        <br />
        <br />
        In many ways this is a loaded question with a multitude of reasonable and potentially valid
        responses (in some realities). For the majority of us, for a large chunk of our lives, if
        not all of it, we are continually told that things are the way they are because that’s just
        how it works. We are told that the system that we know exists to maintain order, keep
        everything in good check, and ensure that each of us can lead happy, healthy, and
        conventionally lucrative lives. We are made to feel that the path that is given to us is the
        correct and responsible path to follow, and to question it will only lead to the complete
        dissipation of any potential energy that we put into hypothesising some unnarratable
        resolve, remaining largely irrelevant as the system persists unperterbed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet, that is all but a completely false premise.
        <br />
        <br />
        Have you ever stopped to really ask whether you could get a better life? I’m sure most of us
        have from time to time. But, converting these ambitions into a tangible reality in a way
        that doesn’t fabricate large asymmetric concavity and downside risk against our favor is
        almost impossible with the way things currently stand. Attempting to break from the “normal”
        comes with a highly probable given that we will confer a free option to those that are
        preserving the system in the first place. We put skin in the game only to increase the
        asymmetry between both the upside and downside that we will gain or lose against those that
        have been granted by the system the means to be able to transfer their risk onto us.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, how do we begin to reclaim this delta, increase our own redundancy and exponentially
        multiply our optionality for maximising each of our own potentialities? Well, web3, in its
        true form, is an absolutely comprehensive key to this fatigued hellish lock, and, even more
        specifically, that too of real DAOs. Decentralisated coordination and collectively aligned
        incentives around governance, actions & motives is a principle initiative for crafting a
        dynamic system that ensures that anyone that puts in the time and effort in adherence to the
        integrity of the DAOs purpose has a clear roadmap for leveling up and seeing the upside they
        deserve; and for anyone that doesn’t, it’s the fair reverse.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s about overcoming the central illusion that we don’t have the ability to really control
        our lives, and collectively coming to the essential base realisation that what we create
        outside of the system surpasses that of anything that might seem sincere from accepting
        things as they are and just operating for the sake of it. Reclaiming our positive delta is
        possible, but more importantly, essential.
