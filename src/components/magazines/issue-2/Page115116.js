       <p className={styles.text1}>3021-humanity, having finally destroyed the earth, completely moved the conscious of the surviving population to a new virtual world. But after a while, chaos ensured and only those most able to adapt to the difficult conditions survived. On the ruins of this digital world, among the deserts and broken textures, the adapted population dwells, utilising the unique technologies to survive.

111Corp - the company that creates the advanced technologies in this new reality. 
<br/><br/>
D. D. C. E_111 is their latest development— made of digital nylon, the glitch camouflage suit helps the population survive in digital storms, deserts, and the ruins of the latest civilization. The suit allows you to hide amongst the textures, and operate at an almost invulnerable state, despite the dangerous environmental conditions. DDCE is the crown hybrid between virtual technology and fashion. </p>
