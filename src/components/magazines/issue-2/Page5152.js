        attaining more strengthened cyclical upturns. Hence, as one can imagine, when investors show
        up to the island purely in furtherance of their own self interest, it turns out to be
        undeniably destructive to the commons, whether they realise it or not. And, unfortunately,
        more often than not, crypto holders have been associated with engaging in this kind of
        endeavor.

        It is a shame really where the current perception of the locals about the web3 community
        stands, and also the lack of more coherent initiative by the broader crypto sphere to truly
        take the time in understanding and appreciating how and why PR is such a focal essentiality
        in further expanding a decentralised creative economy powered by NFTs, crypto, DAOs etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        Puerto Rico is a microcosm of an economy that is extremely well positioned for embedding
        creativity as a positive function of society, where creative vitality can empower and
        promote a multi-generational workforce to new sustainable means that are directly stimulated
        by the progression, adoption and eventual global changeover to a web3 enabled creative
        economy— a community that although can be very much seeded and well formed in Puerto Rico,
        broadcasts huge gains and benefits globally. And this is where the tax structure combined
        with the island’s focus on boosting a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem through additional
        resource allocation and grants, can actually be used for the benefit of supporting and
        protecting the commons; creating low barriers to entry for opportunity, talent discovery and
        genuine breakthroughs, as the development and usage of creative production tools across the
        full spectrum of application capacity can be established from PR to foster not only their
        own local talent, but also attract and inspire other creatives, technologists, entrepreneurs
        to the region to partake in this new ecosystem; from digital fashion, to web3 immersive
        realms, to a crypto powered economy.
        <br />
        <br />
        The capacity to do it the right way and combine the beneficial local economic incentives
        with a truly thriving tech enabled ecosystem is not an impossible feat. In fact, if we
        really all are serious about overturning the legacy models and clearing wider paths for the
        masses to be able to quickly download and access the dexterity required to successfully gain
        from web3, then it’s necessary. Whether a DAO or an individual, the beginnings are for the
        taking.

          What do you think about the relationship between Puerto Rico and the mainland?
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        Growing up I was unsure what the best path forward for the island is. Sometimes it’s a
        family thing. There are good times, and others when you are always fighting, but at the end
        of the day there’s also pride that you’re a part of your family that shares its passions
        loudly and is heading in the same direction.
        <br />
        <br />
        That’s what I used to think. But when I studied more about the history of the relationship I
        learned just how abusive it has been. The forced sterilization of Puerto Rican women,
        military purges in the streets, even banning the Puerto Rican flag for decades. After the
        debt crisis, Maria, and so much more, I finally realized that I was making excuses for the
        US because I didn’t know what would happen to us if we weren’t a Commonwealth or a State.
        Now I call Puerto Rico what it is: the world’s oldest colony. We are supposed to be free, a
        part of the greatest market in the world. While we have a great richness of talent, culture,
        education, and ambition in our people despite all of the challenges we’ve overcome, we are
        still very actively marginalized in our identity and participation in the American
        experiment because of our colonial status.

          Puerto Rico is an island with an intense history and complicated relationship with the US
          mainland. How did that influence your art?
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        So much of art is an expression of who we are and where we come from. There is tension in
        this for everyone. Is it different for Puerto Ricans? In some ways, I say yes. In our
        families and our historical relationship with the US, we come from a place where we all live
        in two or more worlds. There is a split within us, and constant marginalization from where
        we are expected to belong. The struggle to persevere and the stories that come from
        negotiating these tensions in and around us can make for profound art.

        <div className={styles.title}>How did you learn about NFTs and cryptoart?</div>
        <br />
        <br />
        It was the pandemic. I learned to look at so many old things in new ways when locked inside
        for so long.
        <br />
        <br />
        Like many people of this era, my life was always very digital. But I didn’t understand until
        recently how to evolve my art in a way that was like a kind of practical therapy to me, yet
        also valuable to others. I am combining the marginalized parts of myself. How I see myself.
        How much I have been given by my family and the tensions I have with them. The same kind of
        perspective with politics, economics, and the relationship with the US, Latin America, and
        our mixed up European, African, and native Taino heritage. The combining of layers and
        fragments that don’t clearly go together at first has always been the main story of my art.
        It wasn’t clear until maybe the last year how much that has to do with mixing of personal
        expression, social movements, and true financial independence that doesn’t need anyone’s
        permission to create.
        <br />
        <br />
        To be honest I don’t remember which rabbit hole taught me what I needed to know about NFTs
        to recognize the cryptoart movement for what it is. It was really the relentless need to
        combine all these different layers and experiences that took me through a new doorway
        somewhere and opened my eyes one day. I couldn’t be more happy that it did.
