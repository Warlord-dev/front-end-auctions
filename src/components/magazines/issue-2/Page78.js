        Forty years ago, political activist Ralph Nader was at the peak of his fame. Now, he may be
        seen as a dinosaur in the scene, but his stinging rebuke of corporations then still rings
        true to this very day.
        <br />
        <br />
        For far too long, corporations have unashamedly put sales above the health and safety of the
        people they claim to serve and profit from.
        <br />
        <br />
        Examples of corporate malfeasance and lack of accountability underpinned the exposés that
        revealed how corporate executives knew the harm their products or actions could cause — but
        went ahead and did anyway — were and are still rife to this very day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Case in point: Apple literally just admitted to storing thousands of customers' PII on
        Chinese servers and censored apps to kowtow to the government that virtually runs its supply
        chain, making it easy for government agents to drain sensitive information from Chinese
        citizens, including messages, location details, and photos — which is 100% illegal under
        U.S. federal law.
        <br />
        <br />
        Financial impropriety, corruption, bloat, exploitation, cutting corners, and exorbitant
        management salaries are all part and parcel of every organization's challenges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Worse, as organizations grow, the more decision-makers add hoops for employees to jump
        through and inflict increasingly convoluted processes to justify the existence of the rising
        throngs of senior bureaucrats all hoping to keep their jobs until the ax falls. It's
        perfectly normal: network effects are the catalyst of natural monopolies, and centralization
        fosters corruption, censorship, and profiteering behavior for all participants in a given
        ecosystem. The corporate excesses that led to Enron remain a stark reminder of the need for
        better governance and a better organizational structure.

        <div className={styles.subTitle}>Enter DAOs</div>
        <br />
        The key is right here, and it's going to be the next big trend in the blockchain space.
        Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, are computer programs running on
        peer-to-peer networks that incorporate decision-making and governance rules which can be
        programmed to run autonomously, independent from any human involvement, or otherwise can be
        programmed to allow direct control of the DAO and its assets.
        <br />
        <br />
        In essence, DAOs are a novel way of financing projects and governing communities, while
        sharing value for all participants by using Web3 technology and rapidly evolving governance
        and incentive systems to fairly and efficiently distribute decision-making authority and
        financial rewards. No single authority has the authority to decide and make rules. Instead,
        DAOs work with smart contracts to run commands based on external information and operated by
        a
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        community of stakeholders incentivized via an iteration of a token mechanism based on
        participation, contribution, and investment. Token holders can thereafter submit and vote on
        proposals, while sharing in the potential upside.
        <br />
        <br />
        DAOs might have the potential to reshape the way we work, make group decisions, allocate
        resources, distribute wealth, and solve some of the world's biggest problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        In many ways, DAOs work similarly to corporations or governments, but without the monolithic
        hierarchical structures, convoluted layers of bureaucracy, and miles upon miles of red tape
        that traditional organizations run with to this very day. They are the future because they
        were the past. DAOs are organic communities with tokenized asset ownership, while
        corporations are synthetic ones governed by aging hierarchies hellbent on the bottom line
        and the bottom line alone. Humans have existed as a species for hundreds of thousands of
        years, while corporations are a present-day abomination. Traditional institutions, in the
        end, are all created from the same market-making flesh and blood that corporations are — and
        DAOs, like the blockchain, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi), are the ultimate
        solution.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div className={styles.subTitle}>THE DAO: The First Vibratory DAO Experiment</div>
        <br />
        However, it is necessary to make a particular distinction between DAOs as a type of
        organization and THE DAO, which was one of the first attempts at creating a
        blockchain-based, decentralized kind of venture capital fund that allowed commercial and
        nonprofit organizations to secure funding on the Ethereum blockchain. It failed due to a bug
        in the code leading to US$50 million in Ethereum siphoned from the smart contract's
        then-record crowdfunded token capital of over US$160 million. This ultimately led to the
        dissolution of THE DAO and the hard forking of Ethereum as we know it today and Ethereum
        Classic, its original, pre-fork iteration that exists today solely as a speculative ghost
        chain.
        <br />
        <br />
        The collapse of THE DAO caused a rethink about the future of decentralized autonomous
        organizations and set it back a few years. But just five years later, DAOs are re-emerging
        with an entirely new set of various use cases, increasing software toolkits, and new
        incentivization and governance models. And based on the leading thinkers in the scene, DAOs
        will be the next big thing in blockchain technology after NFTs.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div className={styles.subTitle}>DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs: The Emerging Ownership Economy</div>
        <br />
        DAOs are revolutionizing finance as far as ownership is concerned. DAOs are enabling
        individuals to access financial products and services that only the 1% literally had access
        to until DeFi came around. As DeFi protocols continue to thrive since their rise in
        popularity in the last couple of years as decentralized exchanges and yield farming
        platforms emerge, as they rely on them for governance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Moreover, the emergence of NFTs has permanently settled the question of digital ownership —
        and more communities are making the shift from token holders toward becoming DAOs
        themselves. DAOs and NFTs can work together to develop a sustainable economic environment
        built on true democratic, moral, and fair principles. Web3 is just around the corner, and
        DAOs and NFTs will play a key role in how we will solve everyday problems in the rapidly
        developing future.
        <br />
        <br />
        One thing's for sure: the more creators, investors, and digital natives create DAOs and use
        NFTs to lay the foundations on which Web3 will be built, the better the creative world is
        going to be from tomorrow onwards.
