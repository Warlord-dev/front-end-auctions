        Token Value and DAO Structure Optimization: The Common Denominator
        <br />
        The core commonality for all DAO token members is the all-encompassing desire to optimize
        the structure as well as token value. Suppose a member identifies an optimization that
        generates value to token holders. In that case, it is more than enough incentive for members
        to perform them, because it is in their interest to do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        Members can then submit proposals to optimize voting procedures, improve virtual assets,
        increase marketing, etc., explaining concrete steps on what actions to take and how such
        actions will generate value for the community. Therefore, performance assessment relies
        solely on optimizing value rather than whose boot you lick or your politesse. DAOs don't
        discriminate between performance measures — the bottom line is fair remuneration for good
        performance. Not your college background or lack thereof, or the lack of a string of
        acronyms and certifications to the end of your name just to feel good about yourself. As a
        result, DAOs are more democratic than any other iteration of a centralized organizational
        structure in, say, a private company. Everyone has a say in how a protocol develops, and
        everyone truly gets the organization they deserve. That's a far cry from having all that
        power, influence, and direction vested in a council or board of directors who can
        unilaterally and arbitrarily determine the yardstick of value in an organization, leading to
        wasted time and resources on endless and unproductive Zoom meetings and processes that
        impede rather than optimize.
        <br />
        <br />
        DAOs, in the final analysis, are driven by value, and so are their governance and workflows.
        This emphasis on generating value optimizes workflow processes and offers sustainable
        solutions to challenges faced by DAO token holders. In DAOs, only a token holder's
        contributions will determine the influence and outcomes of their endeavors. Nothing else.
        And that's what makes them so revolutionary — by their focus on value to effort workflows.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, all the regulatory bloat that comes with solving the corporate governance
        problems related to shareholders and management is no longer needed. DAOs require less
        supervision, and management constraints are a thing of the past because there are no
        supervisors in a DAO. It all boils down to the token holders advancing the organization's
        interest according to their unique backgrounds and skills, and the incentivization to create
        value based on skill and beliefs, rather than what the powers that be dictate — paving the
        way to a more equitable, fairer society.
        <br />
        <br />
        Existential Hazards
        <br />
        There’s no question about how the potential for DAOs are picking up steam as the world
        recognizes that monetary systems require better governance. DAOs are poised to be the next
        big thing in the blockchain space because of their potential to solve governance problems
        that have been around since time immemorial. But gaps remain, and they are exemplified by
        how some DAOs fall by the wayside and eventually abandoned, when blockchains fork (THE DAO
        debacle leading to the forking of Ethereum in 2016 comes to mind), and when members simply
        quit. Why?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        For all the promise that they bring, DAOs, as of yet, are just starting to scratch the
        surface of finding its elusive product-market fit, or the degree to which a product
        satisfies a particular demand. And much of this lies on a disproportionate focus on making a
        profit.
        <br />
        <br />
        There’s no question that DAOs and the increasing number of communities using tokens can
        potentially be a world-changing paradigm shift waiting to happen. But the pitfalls are real,
        and serious questions must be asked if the space is to evolve.
        <br />
        <br />
        There’s no doubt that tokenization has a ton of benefits. But that doesn’t necessarily mean
        members’ incentives and goals are aligned. Who benefits when an issuer creates no value for
        token holders, or when token holders create no value for an issuer? What, then, incentivizes
        individuals to buy into it apart from speculation?
        <br />
        <br />
        Tokenization has the potential to inject a toxic mindset of profiteering into every
        organization, which can supersede every other non-financial incentive. Communities evolve
        into a network hell-bent on maximizing the bottom line at the expense of brotherhood and
        solidarity, which are thrown out the window in favor of economic self-interest and selfish
        attitudes. It happens everywhere.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tokenized communities can be the most value-driven & effective organizations we’ve ever had.
        To realize that we need to be extremely intentional about ‘social capital.’ Representing it
        too much like financial capital may erode its power rather than capture leverage &
        influence.
      </div>

      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Communities have their own intrinsic existential reasons, motivations, and order amidst the
        chaos, and not all of them can be tokenized and measured. If shareholder return is the
        ultimate value we ascribe to in DAOs, and make that the sole barometer with which we
        determine the success or failure of a DAO, what use do we have for its inherently
        democratic, fair, autonomous, and decentralized nature? What’s good for the goose may not
        necessarily be good for the gander as what makes good financial sense doesn’t necessarily
        mean good organizational relationships.
        <br />
        <br />
        There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, but perhaps one lies in creating an appropriate
        token distribution aligned to what a particular community is trying to achieve. Some
        communities might benefit from more decentralization, some might benefit from less.
        Concentrating tokenomics to the founders and earliest members might be an effective way to
        inculcate and preserve the values that they are espousing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Organized chaos isn’t a solution either. Leaders matter in a world where lines are
        increasingly blurring between communities - and like politics, hierarchy cannot be done away
        with. Effective DAOs have strong missions and visions that are aligned with milestones that
        ensure progress is actually being made.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the end, communities that are able to build a tribe and cement the values that they
        espouse can harness the power of DAOs and their underlying tokenization: organizations with
        truly massive, global, and agile scale, extremely low operational costs, fully-aligned
        milestones, incentives, and motivations to pursue a shared and deeply-ingrained mission and
        vision whose common denominator is to provide value across every endpoint in the ecosystem.
        The key is to constantly test and experiment things, but not to the point of breaking them —
        the mistakes that led to the forking of Ethereum in 2016 still sting to this very day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin perhaps said it best when vast resources of capital cannot
        compete with a project with “soul.” As DAOs rise up as the next big blockchain trend,
        maintaining a balance between both will be quite the highwire act — but those that master it
        will harness the true power that DAOs possess.
        <br />
        <br />
        For what shall it profit a community, if it shall gain the whole world, but lose its soul?
        <br />
        <br />
        Food for thought.
