          Each portion of this digital piece of real estate can be an NFT. These assets are non-fungible; hence they cannot be exchanged 1 for 1. Furthermore, with NFTs secured by the blockchain, they serve as a decentralised immutable proof of ownership of the underlying digital asset — in this case, digital real estate. In essence, digital real estate is another iteration of NFTs like Beeple's record-breaking artwork that possess inherent transferability, and like artwork, can be bought from primary and secondary sales. Games allow players to purchase digital ownership rights — virtual title deeds, as it were — in the form of an NFT. Digital real estate is unbound by building codes, restrictions, and the tricky nature of real estate ownership and dealing with government agencies. And thanks to the power of the blockchain's decentralized ledger, the integrity of these assets is secured.

          <span>The Metaverse Emerges</span><br />
          As the metaverse starts taking shape, virtual worlds are no longer just the realm of the younger set, considering entirely new metaverses are being created for adults for them to inhabit. Furthermore, many of these decentralised virtual worlds existing today are built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling transparent and immutable cryptocurrency transactions for value exchange. 
          <br /><br />
          Existing virtual worlds, including Decentraland, The Sandbox, Cryptovoxels, and Somnium Space are experiencing record high purchases for virtual assets like land, buildings, art, and skins— the virtual economy that supports them is thriving. That hasn't gone unnoticed by industry leaders looking to expand into the metaverse.
          <br /><br />
          Decentraland, one of the first metaverses that came into being, has cleared over $55 million in sales as of the end of April 2021, and its partnerships are heating up. Gaming giant Atari recently signed a two-year lease for prime parcels in Decentraland, where they will soon build the first crypto casino of the metaverse. At a time where physical casino and sports betting establishments have faced widespread closures due to the coronavirus pandemic, players will be able to walk into a virtual casino with their avatar, socialize, and play their favorite games. It's the next logical evolution for live dealer casinos, and it's going to launch this May.
          <br /><br />
          The Sandbox, on the other hand, is another metaverse that has secured critical partnerships with Square Enix, Binance, and Atari, apart from the Winklevoss Twins. They've cleared $19 million in virtual real estate sales as of the end of April. Cryptovoxels and Somnium Space are open, social virtual reality worlds that also feature their own economy, currency, real estate, and social interactions.
          <br /><br />
          <span>Limitless Marketing Potential</span><br />
          As the metaverse grows, so does its user base. And there lies massive, unbound advertising potential for companies to promote their products and services for empowering an immersive, truly unique customer experience. High-traffic areas in the metaverse will also become the digital equivalents of Shibuya Crossing or Times Square.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.rightPart}>
          Once droves of new users start inhabiting the metaverse in numbers that are more than just a drop in the bucket, marketing physical products to people's individual avatars in the virtual realms becomes a breeze. Big companies opening virtual stores in virtual worlds is a natural progression, and they are already starting to do so. However, the interesting feature of building on a web3 layer ensures that it’s not just these big brands and companies that take lead, instead, a flourishing network of independents will have just as much opportunity as the doors to accessing their own value and creating their own ecosystems of liquidity are miniaturized, no longer insurmountable barriers. In fact, as it goes, anyone with a web3 enabled device will be able to access this new economy and actively participate in its growth. 
          <br /><br />
          We're at the conflux of two trends — the fact that people have been forced to stay home and live virtual lives in front of a computer screen on the internet for over a year, as well as a new audience of individuals who grew up playing the Sims, Roblox, or Minecraft. 
          <br /><br />
          There will come a day of reckoning when every project, brand, company, influencer understands that they need their piece of land in the metaverse that offers this unbridled potential to operate in a decentralised and open commercial environment— just like how the web2 era made social pages and websites a necessary currency for distribution and reputation. 
          <br /><br />
          Speculators betting on scarcity can be understood as far as capital appreciation is concerned. A 10x is a 10x in any market, no matter how or where you get it—end of.
          <br /><br />
          But the designers, creators, and players who are technically proficient enough to build on the platform have even greater opportunities. Think of the casinos, museums, art galleries, pubs, and clubs they can build and establish new monetisation models, not just a typical web2 data extraction for advertising purposes. The beauty of the metaverse is that their developers look at them as a platform — a blank canvas, as it were — to build creative structures and assets on them and attract the throngs of new potential users at an unprecedented time where humans need more connection than ever.
          <br /><br />
          Regardless, the virtual real estate industry is already taking giant steps. Skyrocketing NFT and digital real estate prices are potentially just a fraction of what they might be worth in the near future once adoption takes hold. If a digital piece of artwork can be worth $69 million, who's to say virtual real estate can't be worth the same — if not even more?

        <span>NIMBUS</span><br/>
        Pioneering lightweight client implementation for ETH1.0 and ETH2.0. 
        Nimbus allows you to run an Ethereum validator node on esource-restricted hardware (Mobile and Raspberry Pi!!).

      </p>

        <span>MOONI</span><br />
        Crypto off-ramps are still far too inadequate for usage by the broader crypto community. 
        We all know the pain of trying to cash out to pay for IRL expenses with fiat.  
        AND, the ones that do exist are centralized exchanges that take control of your crypto assets and enforce strict KYC / AML processes. 
        It’s not a good experience for any web3 native user. 
      </p>
      <p className={[styles.section4, styles.section].join(' ')}>
        MOONI is changing all of that. It’s a web app that connects to your blockchain wallet and then converts cryptocurrencies to fiat, 
        sending them directly into your existing bank account via wire transfer. There is absolutely no KYC required. 
        It’s a single operation, taking less than a minute. And, it’s still FCA compliant. 
      </p>
      <p className={[styles.section5, styles.section].join(' ')}>
        They are also integrated with Layer 2 solutions like Polygon (Previously Matic) and  xDAI! MOONI currently supports CHF and EUR, 
        with GBP and USD support coming this year! Exciting stuff!

        <span>BEYOND NFT</span><br />
        An interactive NFT format for dynamic NFTs; iNFT. These NFTs can be utilised directly by users on any website with a simple embed. 
        The Beyond NFT platform is driving forward adoption of the new standard. 
        <br /><br />
        iNFTs are ERC721 and ERC1155 standard compliant. They contain a specific unique property, defining their interactivity. 
        The property describes how the NFT works; where to find its code, its configuration and its dependencies. 
        <br /><br />
        Beyond NFT is redefining new use cases for NFTs, where they no longer need to be bound by static metadata. 
        Plus, it’s also available on Polyon and xDAI for Layer 2 compatibility!

        It is one of the most decentralized blockchains with over 6,000 mining nodes. 
        <br /><br />
        IDENA doesn’t require any traditional KYC processes or disclosure of sensitive personal data. Instead, 
        it proves humanness and uniqueness by running an AI-hard Turing test, 
        where all participants from around the globe appear online at the same time in order to solve the test.

        <span>FUNGYPROOF</span><br />
        Where do you go to verify the quality of your NFTs? In today’s crazy market, 
        it’s incredibly difficult— especially if you are new to the space, 
        there are all sorts of caveats from asset storage visibility to groups painting the tape to set higher floor prices. 
        <br /><br />
        FungyProof has created the first NFT grader, scoring an NFT based on factors across asset immutability, metadata, environmental impact and marketability. 
        <br /><br />
        As they put it, “Not every NFT lives up to the hype”, and their aim is to bring more transparency and verified ownership to the space, 
        ranking NFTs based on objective technical factors for future proofed quality assurance.
