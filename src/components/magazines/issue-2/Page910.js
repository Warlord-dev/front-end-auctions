        DAOs and NFTs are powering a business that fosters a spirit of community and collaboration
        under a novel, interdependent ownership structure combining the best of old-school and
        new-school economy and applying it to the emerging digital economy, and the industry is
        constantly evolving as innovative startups blaze a trail through as-yet uncharted worlds.
        <br />
        <br />
        For instance, Rarible is leveraging its RARI token to drive its community-run platform by
        reorganizing it into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization after branding itself as the
        world's first "community-owned NFT marketplace." FlamingoDAO is a for-profit, NFT focused
        DAO that actively investing in NFTs and made a splash after purchasing a rare CryptoPunk NFT
        for a cool US$762,000 in Ether. The LAO takes its cue from THE DAO, allowing members to pool
        capital, invest in projects, and share in any proceeds from the investment. Neptune is a DAO
        focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) that seeks to invest in various liquidity
        opportunities in the ecosystem. DAOs are sprouting up left and right because the
        possibilities are endless, and the future is bright.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div className={styles.subTitle}>The Future of DAOs</div>
        <br />
        It's not outside the realm of imagination that DAOs will likely end up becoming a key
        feature of crypto and outperform traditional hierarchical institutions. But, ultimately, the
        measuring stick with which they will be judged is whether their design advances and
        maintains the community ethos and whether they continue to deliver value for the communities
        they govern.
        <br />
        <br />
        After all, DAOs don't have to be businesses. At its very core, it could be any organization
        whose rules could be arbitrarily decided and agreed upon before or after, just like any
        democracy does in theory. There's nothing stopping the potential outcome where DAOs could be
        the groundwork of how we govern ourselves in the future. The only question lies in the cost
        and how efficiently it can be implemented.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fundamental promise of technology is that it brings a whole new set of new opportunities
        that every single digitalized process has — and that's why their possibilities are endless.
        We're approaching an age where DAOs and crypto protocols will eventually overthrow the
        monolithic dinosaurs like Apple and Google, as well as unsustainably bloating, rent-seeking
        organizational structures whose purpose is to increase shareholder value at all costs.
        <br />
        <br />
        DAOs aren't perfect. Nothing is. But they are strictly better than anything we have today,
        and they will be here for a long time to come. Corporations kill, corporations are
        unsustainable, and corporations are inherently fascist hierarchical structures, and they
        stick out like a relic from the Industrial Revolution where they belong.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maybe Nader was right about corporations all along.
