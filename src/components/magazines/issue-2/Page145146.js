        <p className={styles.text5}>As I've mentioned previously, the concept of a social-commerce virtual world for digital fashion has struck me for a long time—long before stumbling across blockchain, NFTs, or even 3D modeling. It began as a concept for a physical streetwear brand called Fallacy. I wanted the website for the brand to be an interactive virtual world filled with different clothing stores for different product categories within the brand; an accessories/jewelry store, magazine store, shoe store, clothing store, etc, etc. This is where the idea started. 
<br/><br/>
I've since stopped doing physical clothing and the idea has changed quite a bit. Instead, now I envision a virtual world targeted towards everyday creators who wish to start their own digital clothing brands without the hurdles currently stopping them.</p>

      <div className={styles.image9}>
        <p className={styles.text6}>Influencers, Models, Artists, Musicians, etc, can interact with different clothing brands within XENOCITY and create deals with them. One example: a brand provides free NFT garments to the influencer under the agreement that that influencer then promotes by wearing the garment while playing interoperable video games, or wearing that garment on social media. </p>
      </div>
      <div className={styles.image10}>
        <p className={styles.text7}>Designers/brands interact with easy-to-use tools for designing digital clothing garments. Physical products could be paired with these digital NFTs if the brand desires. They also can organize digital events and experiences within the virtual world. Examples would include digital fashion shows, concert events, mini-games. </p>
      </div>
      <div className={styles.image11}>
        <p className={styles.text8}>These are typical users who spend time in XENOCITY shopping for clothing, attending events, participating in experiences.</p>

      <div className={styles.image14}>
        <p className={styles.text9}>Right now the idea of XENOCITY is a virtual world where any designer/brand can build their own digital fashion brand and deploy to the greater Interoperable Metaverse by purchasing digital land/storefront space, building out their clothing collections, designing their storefront, and organizing associated digital events and experiences.</p>

      <img src="./magazine/2/images/145_146/image10.png" className={styles.image15} />
      <img src="./magazine/2/images/145_146/image11.png" className={styles.image16} />
      <div className={styles.image17}>
        <p className={styles.text10}>This concept aligns with an Open-Metaverse future, where it becomes common place to fluidly purchase NFT clothing garments that can be deployed across a multitude of external digital experiences such as games, virtual events (concerts, office meetings, online classes), and social media. In this scenario it is logical that digital clothing will be increasingly adopted and therefore a rise in demand for designers.
        <br/><br/>
XENOCITY would be a virtual world onboarding digital fashion and culture enthusiasts by providing easy-to-use tools for both creating digital clothing, selling that clothing, and designing digital experiences around their brands. 
<br/><br/>
Aesthetically, the setting of the virtual world would be a busy vibrant 3D city inspired by places like Akihabara in Tokyo. There would be clothing stores, event locations, and apartment buildings, all of which would be accessible either to the public, or based on social token and NFT access passes, or through signing with a digital wallet in the case of a private apartment.</p>
