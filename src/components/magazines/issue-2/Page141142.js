        Web3 is turning the centralized chaos into decentralized cosmos at a breakneck pace
        exemplified by DeFi, NFTs, and now, DAOs, towards less extractive hierarchies, governance,
        and compensatory models — reflecting the antifragile nature of life despite unpredictable
        change. The gatekeepers of Web2 are losing their as-yet unchallenged leverage due to this
        creeping decentralization, and they are seething — and they will lash out violently to
        retain it in the face of these antifragile systems that break down. They will put up a
        fight. They will put up walls. They will fight tooth and nail to retain the power they have
        amassed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, black swans will continue to happen, as exemplified by the recent major
        fluctuations in crypto. But when the dust settled, ultimately nothing was broken. Volatility
        is part and parcel of crypto, and if anything, the recent corrections proved crypto’s
        antifragility as a system. Nothing and no one had to be bailed out. No blockchain technology
        went kaput. Nothing went to zero. A bunch of gamblers lost money — nothing more, nothing
        less. Crypto still works — and what didn’t kill it will continue to make it stronger.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nevertheless, the seeds have been sown, and the nascent metaverse is shaping up to be the
        next logical evolution of the internet as we know it — and will continue to do so as long as
        the power of human ingenuity will support it. No amount of political wrangling, regulation,
        or fudding will change that.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ride the tiger. Or better yet, ride the black swan. Food for thought.
