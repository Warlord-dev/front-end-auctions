        The biggest inspiration behind my creative work has been my upbringing and travels. My
        father’s job as a journalist resulted in our family moving from country to country
        frequently. From birth to highschool I moved between Tokyo (birthplace), New York, Rome, and
        Abu Dhabi. I was fortunate to have exposure to many different cultures and international
        experiences growing up, which has informed much of the work I do today. Much of this
        upbringing forced me to quickly adapt to change and learn to embrace it, and for this reason
        change is something I cherish.

        My creative background began with piano lessons when I was very young. I did about 10 years
        of piano lessons which has most definitely been the most formative element of my creative
        journey. In elementary and middle school, while living in Abu Dhabi, I began practicing
        video editing and filmmaking, at first just making fun special effect type videos with
        friends. This eventually developed into more than a hobby as I took up countless filmmaking
        programs and classes, resulting in a strong portfolio of short films by the end of
        Highschool. I went on to attend University of Michigan, where my interest in other art
        mediums began to
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        take over film. Clothing design became primary. A friend and I began a graphic design based
        streetwear clothing brand called Fallacy around 2017. We spent about 2 years developing the
        vision for the brand, perfecting the graphic designs, and teaching ourselves how to sew and
        manufacture the clothing--

      <div className={styles.text6}>
        ultimately getting our clothing on several notable rappers including Sheck Wes. These two
        years were crucial years of creative exploration that ultimately led to me transferring from
        U of Michigan to The New School in New York where I’ve been taking design and art related
        classes.

        The vision for the Fallacy brand consisted of one idea that has consumed me for years since.
        For every Fallacy clothing garment we wanted there to be a digital 3D counterpart. We
        conceptualized an entire 3D virtual world called Fallacy World where our customers would
        shop online (receiving both a physical garment as well as a digital counterpart to be worn
        on their Fallacy avatars). This idea was the driving concept that I cared most about. I
        remember this idea tantalizing me for so long because I had no clue how to pull it off with
        limited resources and zero knowledge of 3D/game design/web development. This reached a
        boiling point where I eventually completely lost interest in the physical side of the brand,
        shifted away from time spent sewing, and decided to tackle 3D, game design, web design. In
        2020, I built a computer, and began learning Blender and Unity and dedicated myself
        entirely. In the final 3 months of the year I basically locked myself in my room and worked
        on a set full day schedule waking at 3, learning the necessary skills and eventually
        building out a prototype of the 3D city I had been envisioning for so many years. It
        definitely took a mental/physical and social toll, but ultimately was a necessary step
        towards eventually realizing my concepts. Towards the end of 2020, as I wrapped up this
        prototype, I came across blockchain and NFTs and have since spun down a massive rabbit hole
        that has led me in a multitude of exciting directions. Blockchain and NFTs are so applicable
        to this concept I could not believe I hadn’t come across them earlier. The first half of
        2021 has been a constant navigation of this new space, trying to familiarize myself with
        web3, blockchains, smart contracts, DAOs, and the Metaverse, which is where I stand now.
        Learning about all of these concepts, especially including other technologies like VR/AR,
        and Artificial Intelligence (particularly GANs) has generated in me such an excitement and
        realization about how unprecedented of a time it is to be an artist in the grand timeline of
        the history of creativity.

        As I mentioned, the primary source of inspiration for my work has been an international
        upbringing and traveling. Particularly, Japan and India have been two of the most impactful
        places I have visited. Collecting is also a defining passion and inspiration. I went through
        an endless list of collecting obsessions including physical things like bottle caps, rubix
        cubes, trading cards (especially Yu-Gi-Oh!), Webkinz, stamps, coins, chess boards,
        gemstones, souvenirs, dvds, and books, and digital things like minecraft items, as well as
        keeping track of every movie and book I've consumed, and logging my daily routines as a
        collection of my experiences. So naturally, finding out about NFTs has been a defining
        moment. On the creative side, other notable sources of inspiration include filmmaker Gasper
        Noe and his film Enter the Void, as well as the ambient album “新しい日の誕生(birth of a new
        day)” by 2814. Most recently the book “The Sleepwalkers” by Arthur Koestler has served as a
        huge inspiration in my recent work and perspective as an artist. The book provides
        fascinating insight into the creative mind, particularly through a lens of the history of
        astronomy, following the story of all the notable astronomers including Copernicus, Kepler,
        and Tycho Brahe to name a few. These insights have really solidified my appreciation for the
        intersections between art and science.

        Though I don't have a huge background in gaming, I am fascinated with the concept of the
        virtual world-- especially one that is more than just a game. Virtual worlds for commerce,
        art, and education are particularly interesting to me and areas that I will dedicate myself
        to building. I have spent a lot of time conceptualizing a Metaverse platform / ecosystem
        based around the 3D city prototype I had built out, one that is particularly focused on 3D
        fashion. In short, the virtual world is a social-commerce platform to support the
        interoperable digital fashion ecosystem. This project which I call XENOTECH is a culmination
        of all the creative work I have done thus far, and I am actively looking for resources and
        guidance and team members to help me build out this vision.
