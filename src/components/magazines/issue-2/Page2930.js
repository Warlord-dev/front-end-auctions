        <div className={styles.subTitle}> Avalaunch </div> <br />
        The first launchpad project on Avalanche— a decentralised platform and protocol for new
        projects in the Avalanche ecosystem to fund-raise and launch their tokens. The platform
        supports projects from the ground up all in the name of enabling greater web3 innovation,
        where projects are able to offer their tokens for sales across a variety of different
        options, including; fixed price pools, custom bonding curves, multiple auction types, etc.
        Token sale allocations for each project is split across three tiers;
        <br />
        -The first tier will be for $XAVA stakers, who will get guaranteed allocation based on time
        and amount of tokens staked.
        <br />
        -The second tier is for Avalanche chain validators and delegators (evidence of the
        Avalaunch’s focus on supporting the Avax ecosystem)
        <br />
        -And the third tier will be a public tier, open to everyone.
        <br />
        The tier mechanics in itself ensures deep and stable liquidity for the project from day one,
        where tier 1 underwrites utility and demand for the $XAVA token over time (And since
        allocations are also based on time staked, we can imagine a large share of the supply will
        be locked in staking at all times, decreasing circulating supply), and tiers 2 and 3 ensure
        a broader distribution of tokens, and also help advance further the Avalanche ecosystem by
        providing yet another incentive for users to become validators and delegators in the
        network.

        <div className={styles.subTitle}> INVERSE FINANCE </div>
        <br />
        Inverse Finance is a simple, clean and highly effective earnings protocol, depositing users
        funds into yield aggregators and then automatically converting the earned yield into another
        crypto of choice, and so allowing users to maintain exposure to their target tokens of
        choice i.e. deposit $DAI into Inverse Finance and you can have your APY returns
        automatically converted to $ETH. However, further to this, and probably Inverse’s most
        innovative product is their lending protocol, based on a mixed synthetic & credit stable
        coin, $DOLA, where you receive both a synthetic stable coin in exchange for deposit
        collateral, and also borrowing credit. This means that you can deposit $ETH to borrow $DOLA
        and either spend this $DOLA elsewhere or use it as collateral to take out loans in other
        assets, all while earning yield on your $ETH collateral.

        <div className={styles.subTitle}> OCTOFI </div>
        <br />
        OctoFi offers all DeFi solutions, from token swaps, liquidity mining, lending, orderbook
        trading, derivatives trading, token set investing, NFTs to fiat on and off ramps, all from a
        single user-friendly platform with great design. OctoFi can be thought of as an interface
        with the major existing DeFi platforms, so it will execute a swap or provide liquidity using
        Uniswap, Sushi, Balancer, etc, do orderbook trading through 0x, borrow crypto using Aave, or
        trade NFTs through Opensea. The efficiency this brings to users is unmatched where, for
        example, if you wanted to do a swap between two tokens, OctoFi will aggregate data from 32
        exchanges, including Uniswap, Sushiswap, 1inch, Balancer, Ox, Airswap, Kber, Bancor, Radar
        Relay and others, and recommend the one with the best price at that moment. On top of this,
        OctoFi also has it’s own native token, $OCTO, that will be used for governance on the
        platform, and, 100% of platform fees will be distributed to $OCTO holders! These fees will
        come from spot trading fees (0.2%), and partner commissions on swaps, fiat gateways or NFT
        trading.
