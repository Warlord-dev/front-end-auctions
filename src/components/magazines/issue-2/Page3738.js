        These NFTs can be programmable, tradable, interoperable and composable. This composable
        approach towards fashion, verified by the blockchain, is a major leap in digital materials
        and design ownership, digital supply chain management, process automation, efficacy
        management.

        FGO is built native to web3— where both the Ethereum blockchain and Polygon Network are
        leveraged for the minting and issuance of each 1155 NFT. Polygon ensures that the minted
        NFTs are in check with the broader revolution of what digital fashion enables— a more
        efficiently sustainable supply chain and fashion industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        FGO also promotes the broader mission for enabling gatemakers of the metaverse. Modding the
        Metaverse. The metaverse is nothing more than a radical reduction in the barriers between
        us. As these barriers come down, as the gates minaturise, the friction that might stop us
        normally from any given choice dissipates, allowing for new modes of interaction that are
        inherently fluid and liberating. And, with that said, modding is the fundamental practice
        that drives growth and change in fashion, gaming, mechanics… everything. The methodology
        behind modding and the byproducts that come from it are what actually build the metaverse.
        And, not just build the metaverse but also ensure that it will be kept open, vital and
        continuously unique to each personal experience.

        Fractional Garment Ownership is an immediate first step towards reinforcing the ground roots
        growth and authenticity of our ecosystem to be comprehensively responsive to the commons
        from the most modular, composable and programmable level — the pattern, material and texture
        level — as the building blocks for streamlining an entirely on-chain and open source supply
        chain that can be scaled across both the digital and physical realms; underpinned by ERC
        protocol standards (1155, 721, 998). Open is important, because this time around we must do
        it right.

      <div className={styles.text2}>
        Through FGO we are building out an entire Global Designer Network of creators that align
        with our mission of decentralisation and open source for the fashion industry. We are here
        to revolutionise the entire industry and do it right; overturning gatekeepers that have
        become comfortable with closed, exploitative, predatory, unsustainable and studio dominant
        bullshit.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a very special first initiation, each designer in our network has crafted a digital
        material, pattern, texture print that they personally minted on-chain, with their wallet
        addresses, through the DIGITALAX Polygon 1155 NFT smart contracts, open sourcing this into
        our material, texture, pattern libraries.
        <br />
        <br />
        This first step is all about enabling the commons. A commons cannot exist if we ignore the
        actions, models, systems and arrangements that are destructive to the commons. All too
        often, and very much native to the extractive web2 structure currently in place, power goes
        to those that steal a free option from society. Optimising purely for self interest in the
        short term results in a situation where an individual benefits themselves whilst
        simultaneously spreading out negative effects across the larger population. It is not just
        pitting short term self interest against the common good, but, moreso, it is actively
        destroying the rest of the population, ecosystem, and co-existing environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        The commons is a societal resource where access is guaranteed to all, beyond the control of
        any centralized authority. It’s about ensuring that preservation of the collective is
        injected into the complexity of the web3 systems we are continuing to build out; ensuring
        that our ecosystem is incentivized to operate as an open bazaar — where a higher level of
        direct exchange optimises the effectiveness of the emergent evolutionary process for
        eradicating false positives and unlocking progressive decentralisation and utility of the
        ecosystem in general.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each FGO 1155 NFT, by the Global Designer Network, has been minted under the DIGITALAX
        <a href="https://digitalax.xyz/fgo-2">
          Fractional Garment Ownership License and Distribution Standard 1.2
        </a>{' '}
        with a Degree of Exclusivity as Common— further reinforcing the enablement of this group.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          This is just the start, where eventually, the designer network and on-chain libraries will
          open up points of entry and capacity for anyone to engage fully in dynamic decentralised
          commerce, driven by ubiquitous digital fashion and cross digital-physical realms.{' '}
        </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        These FGO NFTs will be leveraged under the FGO open source licensing standards, where
        DIGITALAX is taking the first initiative of proving out the model cross-realm (digi-fizzy)
        in our hybrid DRIP digital-physical fashion line— incorparating these patterns and prints
        with a royalty distribution of 15% back to the OG designers behind the modular components
        that will be incoporated across different master physical garments. The master physical
        garment will be minted as a 721 NFT with the 1155 patterns incorporated attached to it under
        DIGITALAX’s ERC-998 variant standard.
        <br />
        <br />
        An opening to web3 digital fashion that is ready for the metaverse and powered by the
        commons.
