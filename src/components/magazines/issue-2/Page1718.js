        Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are shaping up as the next big trend in
        blockchain technology after NFTs.

        <br />
        DAOs represent a new paradigm in financing projects, governing communities, and sharing
        value within a particular environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a nutshell, DAOs codify an organization's rules, processes, and decision-making
        capability, thereby dismantling the rigid top-down hierarchies that are pervasive in today's
        organizations. Rather than hierarchy, DAOs use Web3 technology and rapidly evolving
        governance and incentivization models for distributing authority and financial rewards by
        some iteration of tokenization. Then, holders of said tokens are able to submit governance
        proposals, vote, and take their piece of the pie.
        <br />
        <br />
        DAOs answer the question that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin asked: can management be
        removed from the equation even if human beings are still needed to perform specific tasks?
        <br />
        <br />
        Thus far, we've seen the evolution of blockchains, smart contracts, decentralized finance
        (DeFi) protocols, and decentralized applications (dapps) in a short amount of time. If these
        are all tools that devs use to build the emergent ecosystem, then DAOs represent the groups
        of individuals who use them. Thus, DAOs are practically the successor of organizations or
        corporations on Web3. And as with any nascent technology that requires experimentation, it
        is but a foregone conclusion that DAOs have unpredictable properties whose effects will only
        be known down the line.
        <br />
        <br />
        DAOs enable their stakeholders to have direct consensus control over the organizations they
        own a portion of through their tokens, allowing them to conduct their politics without any
        middlemen and guarantee that every stakeholder gets what they truly deserve.
        <br />
        <br />
        Supporters of DAOs believe that they have the immense potential to redefine the way people
        work, organize, allocate resources, distribute value, and solve the world's biggest
        problems. But just as the Notorious BIG once said, mo' money, mo' problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Great DAO Heist of 2016: Too big, Too soon
        <br />
        Opportunity creates the thief, and with the money that flowed (and still flows) into DAOs,
        it was all just a matter of time before unscrupulous actors would take advantage of their
        vulnerabilities. One of the most infamous attacks on Ethereum was related to a DAO called
        "The DAO." The DAO was the forerunner to a decentralized venture capital fund allowing for
        the democratization of how Ethereum projects would be funded. The vision behind DAOs like
        The DAO was to create a self-driven organization that coded many of the day-to-day processes
        to create a leaner, more efficient one without the centralized hierarchy we have all been
        used to. Token holders share the profit that DAOs generate while allowing them to vote to
        fund projects they like.
