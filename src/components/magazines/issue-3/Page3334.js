      <p className={styles.text2}>PALM.IO New Energy Efficient NFT Marketplace</p>   
      <p className={styles.text3}>Palm is a new soon to be launching PoS sidechain for Ethereum. It was announced under ConsenSys and is the latest NFT-centric scaling solution to enter the space. It’s an interesting alternative to the Flow blockchain that powers NBA topshot and </p>   
      <p className={styles.text4}>has enabled significant traditional media exposure around NFTs, carrying in a lot of market expansion through partnerships with big winners from the old economy. It’s too early to tell which operational direction Palm will take, however, its deeps root in Ethereum certainly establishes it as one to watch. Ethereum represents the authentic core of what web3 is all about. It’s an open bazaar that promotes decentralisation through automated incentive systems. Having another scalable NFT platform as part of this ecosystem will surely only strengthen the diversity and vitality that it fosters. 
<br/><br/>
It all leads to the bigger question though; with so many NFT marketplaces launching, who will survive? It’s not to say that there isn’t a market need for more efficient and scalable transactional infrastructure for these digital goods, however, if we don’t continue</p>
      <p className={styles.text5}>to increase application and utility use cases alongside sustainable infrastructure development then there will be a lot of highways and not very many cars. 
      <br/><br/>
NFTs are guaranteed to eventually become just another feature of the metaverse, and swapping mechanics will be the under the hood invisible components. The startup/tech entrepreneur world often goes through predictable phases like clockwork, and the latest certainly seems to include that of NFT marketplaces. However, the stumble comes when we mistake a feature for a unicorn. Everyone makes a search engine, everyone makes a social media app, everyone makes a Clubhouse... until they realise that ‘it’s just another app on my phone or dial on my radio.’
<br/><br/>
There needs to be a lot more in place than just buy and sell mediums. Communities don’t form and consumer behaviour isn’t driven by the overly technical details of how your system operates. The winning products, platforms, protocols and networks will ultimately be those who best serve the protection against pain and desire for growth of the people they hope will use their services. And ultimately this is what I’m really talking about when it comes to sustainability— it goes far beyond energy efficiency. </p>
      <p className={styles.text6}>Carbonbase</p> 
      <p className={styles.text7}>Carbonbase</p> 
      <p className={styles.text8}>We often here about all the problems with climate change and the environment, but less emphasis is placed on the relationship between how we are personally impacted and what effective action we can each take to properly do something about it. Carbonbase realised this back in 2019, and alongside that realisation they started building out an entire ecosytem that connects regular consumers with the ability to calculate their carbon footprints and then offset this through investing in certified carbon offset projects from around the world. All of this is incentivised through a meta rewards program, where seed points are earnt from investments and then can be used across a global community of ecosystem partners for various deals and discounts. 
      <br/><br/>
It’s not native to the blockchain as of yet, but, it’s an interesting project to highlight either way, especially due to the fact that their global loyalty points program presents a great use case for integration with decentralised incentive systems including that of DeFi. Imagine being able to take your seed points, which could be alikened to a sort of LP token on your investment, and then earn yield through staking, be granted fees from an AMM or, better yet, leverage this up through a lending/borrowing pool to then be able to access an even larger pool of </p> 
      <p className={styles.text9}>capital for reinvestment into the eco projects and so maximise impact. 
      <br/><br/>
DeFi usage for alturistic purposes is still a relatively untouched sector. But, when you start to dig more deeply into the potential of the space, it’s pretty clear just how much more suited the combination of decentralised technologies and crypto incentive models are over traditional finance. This is evident from many aspects, including the more obvious perspective of simply reducing financial friction so that invested funds can reach their destination of intent with transparent verification, and thus, ensure maintenance in the fidelity of what the investment set out to achieve in the first place. And more broadly, that touches on a bigger point of “Why blockchain”— it removes all of the middle opaque crap so that you can do what you set out to do or get what you set out to get under fair conditions. </p>
