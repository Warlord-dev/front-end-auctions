         <p className={styles.text5}> In the previous content I broke down how the XENOTECH virtual world would be structured. The primary NFTs that users would interact with are clothing stores, apartments, and clothing wearables.</p>

         <div className={styles.image3}></div>
         <p className={styles.text8}>Across the city there would be 3D retail spaces that designers and brands could rent or purchase (as NFTs) and subsequently customize and launch clothing stores for both their digital and physical products. Depending on the scenario, these stores would either be persistently open to the public, or they could be scheduled NFT ticketed pop-up store events. Scarcity is a crucial characteristic of streetwear and fashion and the reason that people will line up and even camp on the street overnight for a Supreme drop.</p> 
         <div className={styles.image4}></div>
         <p className={styles.text9}>In a virtual world, a brand could replicate this sort of scarcity thrill for clothing drops by pre-selling a limited number of tickets (NFTs or social tokens) that would grant their holders private access to the 3D clothing store upon the drop. Upon purchasing an NFT clothing garment from a brand, a customer could then view the garment in their inventory and equip it on their avatar. Users could also purchase their own NFT apartment within the virtual world where they could display their clothing garments and other 3D NFT objects.</p>

        <div className={styles.image12}></div>
        <p className={styles.text12}>Clothing, especially interoperable digital clothing, is a key aspect of the Open-Metaverse. Currently there are so many barriers faced by people who wish to create digital clothing. It requires an investment in a decent computer, as well as dedicated time to learning 3D modeling programs like CLO3D and Blender. There should be a dedicated simple 3D modeling interface that would allow users (without 3D experience) to easily create custom digital clothing garments based on open-sourced templates and patterns that could then be minted as NFTs and accessible within the virtual world in a few clicks. By making the experience simple and intuitive it would introduce a whole new class of digital fashion designers / brands who previously lacked access or skills regarding 3D programs.</p> 
        <div className={styles.image13}></div>
        <p className={styles.text13}>For a designer or brand, ideally the journey could be as simple as: 
<br/><br/>
1. selecting a open-sourced pre-designed garment template (blank shirt, hoodie, pants, shoes, etc...) <br/>
2. customizing the garment with their own graphics, materials, textures. <br/>
3. minting the garment as an NFT directly in the interface.<br/>
4. displaying the garment for sale inside of the digital clothing retail space (NFT land)</p>
