     <p className={styles.text2}>Peezy R.</p> 
     <p className={styles.text3}>DeFi’s proponents have made a strong case that the emerging use case for cryptocurrencies casts a wide net for individuals and institutions to participate in a financial ecosystem that’s permissionless and disintermediated—one that they would never have even dreamed of being able to access until the advent of blockchain technology came about (and had a baby and called it DeFi.)
<br/><br/>
For its fledgling participants, DeFi presents an opportunity that would enable them not just to serve as a hedge against the traditional financial system’s known pitfalls but as a way to actually support livelihoods and uplift economic conditions for its participants rather than just some grubby Wall Street fat cat. It’s an opportunity that matches the Silicon Valley ethos of building, breaking, and rebuilding things as well as empower individuals, with a disdain for centralized, top-down structures—without saying anything about how Silicon Valley itself became centralized (that’s a story for another day). Good stuff.
<br/><br/>
Like many things about blockchain and financial technology, DeFi might invariably sound like esoteric, perplexing claptrap to the uninitiated. And this supposed “barrier” to entry has invariably led to said individuals eschewing entering the DeFi space altogether.
<br/><br/>
Yes, everyone can participate in DeFi—but like anything, the know-how is sold separately.
<br/><br/>
Let’s face it: DeFi is indeed a potentially world-changing application of blockchain technology as we know it. But the learning curve is real.
<br/><br/>
Don’t worry, fam, we got you—we’ve all been there.
<br/><br/>
Fortunately, DeFi isn’t rocket science. 
<br/><br/>
You don’t need a master’s degree in blockchain technology to get started right now. 
<br/><br/>
You don’t need to be a computer whiz to understand the underlying mechanisms that support DeFi.
<br/><br/>
You don’t need to jump through all sorts of regulatory and institutional hoops designed to make your money work for you as you would have to with a bank, a fund, or a financial institution.</p> 
      <p className={styles.text4}>You don’t need millions of dollars to “get into” DeFi. No high finance apparatchik is going to turn you down because you have a bad credit score or because you aren’t “worthy enough” to be given the privilege of being served  (“As cold as a banker’s heart” isn’t an idiomatic expression for nothing.)
<br/><br/>
Granted, basic financial literacy is always a plus—but not a hard-and-fast prerequisite to participate in this exciting new financial paradigm.
<br/><br/>
And one of the best ways to get started with DeFi is to understand how it distinguishes itself from its brother, centralized finance (CeFi)—the long-standing, bloated, and rigid financial framework that DeFi is in the process of disrupting. And with $55 billion in total locked value as of this writing (and growing), it is perhaps high time we shed some light on this aspect of DeFi. 
<br/><br/>
A brief history of CeFi<br/>
Financial transactions we would have otherwise called “banking” have always been around ever since the first known form of human currency was recorded in history. Since then, banking has grown into an unbridled economic force driven by big finance—the gargantuan institutions that serve individuals or provide loans to a country teetering on economic breakdown.
<br/><br/>
But as with any industry, centralization paralyzes customers who are left at the mercy of gatekeepers lacking transparency. This leaves them without the security they need to empower themselves to take control of their own wealth and welfare. 
<br/><br/>
It is ultimately this excessively centralized, immobilizing structure, one that’s experiencing rapidly decelerating trust in—one that DeFi seeks to change.
<br/><br/>
How does DeFi work?<br/>
DeFi has no formal dictionary definition, so to speak, but in general, it involves leveraging the blockchain to support credit functions, loans, borrowing, lending, and enable auctions; to trade in esoteric derivatives; to trade crypto assets against each other, or to engage in novel iterations of insurance. The potential profit opportunities arising from DeFi lie largely in part due to the disintermediation of traditional finance, including their exorbitant fees and its soviet regulations.
<br/><br/>
In a nutshell, smart contracts on the blockchain are what power decentralized finance, allowing for the creation of layers upon layers of complex, synergistic transaction systems. </p>
