      <p className={styles.text3}>A strong divide between the broader ‘crypto’ community continues to ensue as Bitcoin maximalists ramp up their declaration, vocalisation and ascertion that Bitcoin will be the only surviving future digital asset. Period. </p> 
      <p className={styles.text4}>The Peer 2 Peer RugPull</p>
      <p className={styles.text5}>One of the most principle elements of web3 and crypto is how it elegantly intersects value exchange and community networks, designing systems around it in a way that inherently reduces fricton between people. Afterall, that really was Satoshi’s vision— a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a trusted third party, and instead based on cryptographic proof. 
      <br/><br/>
Whether he completely intended for it or not, Satoshi ignited a Cambrian Explosion of newly coordinated activity, tools, protocols and communities around replacing the old centralised and expolitative systems with vigorously generative decentralised infrastructure. Yet, with his anonymous identity preserved in full alignment and reinforcement with how Bitcoin is meant to work for every user, it has left flexibility for anyone interacting with the ecosystem to build new versions of the initial vision and improvise on the theme. And, for better or worse one of these itterations is that of the Bitcoin Maxis. </p>
      <p className={styles.text6}>So, for those that don’t know, what are Bitcoin Maxis? Well, they are those that hold the belief that Bitcoin is both the obviously superior coin amongst all of the live trading cryptos, and, also, that it will be the ONLY transactable, universally accepted, useable and needed digital asset. In other words Bitcoin go brrr, other coins go zero. 
      <br/><br/>
Without focusing too much on the toxicity, narcissm or often unfounded straw man style tactics that these Maxis pull in order to support and back up their loud beliefs, it’s important instead to go right to the heart of the argument and detail out just why a multi-chain, multi-coin, multi-purpose ecoystem is absolutely necessary for Bitcoin to survive. 
<br/><br/>
The whole premise of decentralised sound money depends on an open access economy to spend it all. The way that this is ensured is through a robust incentives infrastructure where custom transactions and purpose specific pools of resources, content and liquidity can generate new solutions for group needs that are lucrative to each participant involved. Economics is always about incentives and if we don’t get these right then we can just look to our past and present to see how it turns out— extractive, expoitative, destructive to future growth potential and not only hindering to the proper functioning of the system but also actively insertive of friction to every point of interaction and exchange. </p>
      <p className={styles.text7}>Token ecosystems aren’t what the media often portrays them to be; quick financial gainz, pump and dump perpetual machines and simple code for spinning up a money laundering complex. Although, yes, they’ve been used in that way by some, it’s really not at all what makes them so distinct and dare I say it, even revolutionary. Token ecosystems allow anyone/thing to radically reduce the barriers to value exchange and therefore creation, circulation and growth around whatever it is that market participants desire most. 
      <br/><br/>
And, for that fact, their must be more than one. It’s the antithesis of Highlander; there MUST be more than one! If there isn’t, then not only does it mean that no matter how correct or not the implementation of Bitcoin might be, there will never be any broader ecosystem for it to thrive within. It dies without a host to live in. The muli-layered paradigm is not only at the heart of the very concept of decentralisation, where there can’t be just one node, but it’s what drives the incentive system for the evolution of blockchain and decentralised technologies as a whole. 
<br/><br/>
So with all this said, if we are all really here for the reasons that we say we are here for, at the end of the day, whether it’s a Bitcoin, an Altcoin or a Shit coin, if it’s serving our needs and the conditions needed for additional innovation in web3 then does it really matter? If you ask me, the more the better. </p>
