      <p className={styles.text20}>“Have you ever thought of having your own token?” A casual social prompt on my first meeting with my future collaborator, European music tech startup Staxe that I had no idea was going to turn into a life-changing pivot and set me on a crash course into the dizzying, constantly evolving world of DeFi. As a lifelong artist and music technologist, I’ve always eagerly embraced new ways of releasing material and interacting with fans, but had huge blind spots in the finance and logistical realm. Freelance independents like myself are used to being denied loans; explaining our “quirky” lifestyles to institutions; and ending up being gatekept by industry titans when it comes to producing our own live shows, albums or other creative endeavours. </p>

      <p className={styles.text16}>I’ve been an artist in many forms for over two decades, starting out as a vinyl-slanging teenage MC and DJ, learning music production and touring the Americas, Europe and Asia, and gradually letting my passion for new tech evolve my sound into ever more futuristic and experimental genres. But over my career I’ve watched my former passionate universe of underground music evolve into just another major-label-run, commercially valued asset. Current platforms of choice like Spotify pay fractions of pennies for plays, and foster an atmosphere of desperation and inadequacy among my peers, as we compete for the most plays, the biggest playlists, in an environment where the artist is not valued and the concept of making something totally original can actually hurt your career.</p>  
      <p className={styles.text18}>My journey has only accelerated as I become more aware of the limitless potential for independent creators to achieve both financial and creative freedom through DeFi, and Staxe and I are now launching a collaborative video and livestream series which turns Cryptowaves into free and fun education about DeFi protocols, practices, and crypto-based sound design, with accompanying regular NFTs! The entire project is tokenized for investment - token holders will receive shares in the project’s success, as well as ongoing perks like VIP entries, exclusive special events and other unique collectibles. Our future goals are to further expand into forming a new form of decentralized collective collaboration; potentially, to form an artist-run DAO, where the project’s early adopters and future ones converge to form an organization with its own economy - fueled by its tokenholders’ votes and efforts, whose success is transparently and efficiently shared amongst all</p>  
      <p className={styles.text19}>For the first time, I truly feel like an independent artist, with the ability to create my own projects in my own economic universe; and I have a new mission to empower others in my community with the same knowledge.</p>  
      <p className={styles.text21}>
<br/><br/>
As a novice and peripheral crypto user, my only previous experience with DeFi was an early adopter airdrop from the Audius platform, which I had exchanged for Ethereum and left to sit. I had absolutely no idea that an entire ecosystem of independence like this was evolving, and soon found myself planning a new world with Staxe - the ability to tokenize my entire creative production, obtain funding that was free and clear from “Big Music” (the massive corporations monopolizing the industry), and create new potential to literally create fans that were more invested i</p>  
      <p className={styles.text22}>n me as an artist. Although their main MO is to tokenize live music events, we realized that there is endless potential in tokenizing an artist’s work or an ongoing specific project. Through playing with this new system, I was able to fund my first NFT concept project, “Cryptowaves” - music made from cryptocurrency graphs and using DeFi protocol terms as lyrics, and augmented with motion-capture video and 3D animations that were previously beyond what I could afford on my own.
      <br/><br/>
What first intrigued me about NFTs is that they represent the opposite: instead of catering to the masses and trying to hit the magic formula, the artist is curating something meant to be extraordinarily special and unique, that will maintain value in its originality and scarcity. This sparked my brain on a multitude of audio and visual levels - parts that I had honestly shut off, believing that it was not possible in the competitive world of EDM to be this experimental and still pay my electric  bills. Within a matter of weeks, I created an entire fantasy world and narrative of a young digital avatar born inside the blockchain and her journey to self-actualization. Staxe then tokenized and funded what may be the world’s first live NFT auction close/concert hybrid, where several artists performed on stream while their auctions were displayed, and VIP visitors could access a virtual club and art gallery through our other partner, Soundstage.fm.</p>

My work is centered around bringing the multi-dimension of Black Femme narratives to the forefront, energy, healing, and empowerment. I have been a transcendent creative touring, diving and mixing between music, performance and visual for 8 years but feel like I’m having a rebirth through the blockchain and NFT. </p>

      <p className={styles.text30}>Creative Process</p>  
      <p className={styles.text31}>It’s pretty diverse depending on timing, but in the past, I would get into a zone, write the story, make the music around the story, let go and/or keep parts of the story, work on a roll-out, make music visuals, release by roll-out, cry, PR push, tour, review, wait months or years for streaming payments and repeat. </p>  
      <p className={styles.text32}>The process now through web3 and NFT is more multifaceted, allows for more true direction without worry of the traditional music industry, an emergence of a new audience that speaks directly to me, the allowance of greater collaborative works, and the agency to pretty much do whatever I want. More choice, more fun, more resources, and more wellness for all I encompass.</p>  
      <p className={styles.text33}>There are several, but I think my favorite was mg “MAKDA VERSE” drop on ZORA. It was the first Hip Hop music video approach to NFT. It additionally was created by 3 womxn artists and coined me the first female Hip Hop artist in NFT. I’m pretty proud of it and feel sometimes these moments haven’t been fully acknowledged or understood for many reasons, but the ability to bring music to the forefront of NFT means a more open future for more musicians who have been caught in the web of problems within the industry. 
      <br/><br/>
I also found RAC’s token to be critical, Mark de Clive-Lowe’s recent film and music drop “Motherland” and Vérité approach in sharing her Master’s with a fan to be highly important. Overall I’m really excited for what Catalog and ZORA are giving us the freedom to do and choose. It will impact the industry for the better and in the long term. </p>
