      <p className={styles.text5}>1. You’ve had a front row seat and back stage pass to the entire run up of visual NFTs. Why do you think now is the right time for audio NFTs?</p>
      <p className={styles.text6}>It's easier to land a placement for an audio file than a visual file. The first stage of NFT collecting was patronage - collectors supported artists to empower their craft. The next chapter is true ownership - and with that, there are more proven channels for audio to be monetized (think Spotify, Audius, podcasts, etc.). We're going to see a huge wave of artists looking to share master royalties with their fans and audio NFTs will be the main way in which this is done.</p>
      <p className={styles.text7}>2. Not everyone knows this but you actually studied the business of music in school, how has what you’ve experienced in web3 both in general and in music specifically either changed your perspective on what you were taught or contradicted what you were taught?</p>
      <p className={styles.text8}>Nice homework! Having started my career in music and then going full-time crypto, I was able to take a step back and look at the music industry with a new lens. The entertainment at large is structured very differently from the start-up world, and with it comes a new sets of opportunities and challenges. Working in web3 has shown me that giving true ownership to your community is the only path forward. A lot of artists in music preach a two-way relationship with their fans, but very very few are actually doing it well. I believe that crypto is the way for artists to be incentivized and empowered by engaging with their fans on a more meaningful level.</p>

      <p className={styles.text9}>3. We’ve seen a variety of projects experimenting with social tokens. WTF are social tokens and what do you think is special about them? </p>
      <p className={styles.text10}>Social tokens are digital assets that represent a brand, individual or community. Social tokens give projects that historically not be well suited to raise outside capital an opportunity to source capital and deploy it as a community. It adds a dimension of shared ownership and upside that allows any contributor to earn financial and social capital from their work. Social tokens will power the Creator Economy and the rise of micro-economies.</p>
      <p className={styles.text11}>4. Have you seen any interesting projects combining audio NFTs and social tokens?</p>
      <p className={styles.text12}>The closest to it is Mirror. They offer tools for crowdfunding through both NFTs and social tokens. With Mirror, you can back a crowdfund and receive a social token in return. The act of backing the crowdfund could also come with an NFT attached to it. Right now, most creators are tying together 2-3 separate platforms (Catalog, Mirror, Foundation, NIFTEX) to experiment with fractionalization - the easiest way to add a social token component to any NFT. I'm most excited for a forthcoming platform called Fractional to be a leading player in fractionalization and I expect audio NFTs to be a big part of its ecosystem.</p>
      <p className={styles.text13}>Coopahtroopa</p>
      <p className={styles.text14}>5. So, where to next?</p>
      <p className={styles.text15}>The Creator Economy is here to stay. I'm spending most of my time these days on DAOs as a direct onramp to wider Creator Economy sustainability. By giving a digital community a foundation through a DAO, we can start to see really cool experiments like NFTs at concerts, governance over festival lineups and much much more. I couldn't be more excited to watch the Creator Economy take crypto mainstream in the next 3-5 years.</p>

      <p className={styles.text19}>stakerwatch<br/>
<span className={styles.text20}>With Layer 2s and side chains being all the rave, have you ever wondered what the flow of activity and token transfers really is between Ethereum mainnet and these </span></p>
      <p className={styles.text21}>other protocols? Stakewatch has deployed an interactive web interface for tracking exactly this, but, in a human friendly way with Ethhole.link. The total value tracked is calculated by tokens deposit to bridge contracts and the staked tokens on Ethereum.</p>
      <p className={styles.text22}>Llama<br/>
<span className={styles.text23}>With DAOs becoming more and more popular, so are the services being created and developed out around them. Llama is one of those, providing treasury management for DAOs and DeFi protocols. As we are all aware, crypto is a highly dynamic and active ecosystem where it’s never enough to just rely on the expected routine— whether that be in the form of token price action, developer operations, managing deployments of high stakes smart contracts and/or community coordination and vitality. Thus, not only is efficient treasury management vital for being able to effectively respond to this dynamic environment, but also, it is necessary for guaranteeing a project’s ability to move in inertia with the constantly evolving currents, rather than being stuck in a position for having to battle against them. 
<br/><br/>
Llama’s services include everything from asset allocation to financial planning and reporting, where DAOs are able to categorize transactions and access real-time financial statements. The relevance of this becomes even more clear when considering what is required to operate a real DAO and uphold community transparency as a core pillar to this. </span></p>
      <p className={styles.text24}>Illuminate finance<br/>
<span className={styles.text25}>For the majority of people, understanding complex algorithmic DeFi protocols isn’t something that can just be contemplated over in simple time. Yield farming, staking, yield aggregators, swaps, flash loans etc. come as a completely new language, heuristic and behavior. And, especially as DeFi grows and scales in terms of the number of projects and protocols building and releasing products in the space; it becomes even more difficult to separate the signal from the noise and know exactly where one should go to find reasonably protected exposure to gainz. 
<br/><br/>
Aggregators are a fundamental building block for scaling DeFi and crypto to a wider audience, and Illuminate is supporting this cause by offering Fixed Yield Aggregator that finds the best current fixed rate yield across a number of different protocols, simplifying the experience for users as they start exploring this new field. </span></p>
      <p className={styles.text26}>Thx<br/>
<span className={styles.text27}>We’ve all heard the gamification buzzword a bunch of times. But what does it mean and why do we need it? Well, ultimately, it’s all about guiding the user’s experience in a way that is more engaging and appealing for them, so that they can achieve the outcome, goal or skill better, faster and with a much higher guarantee of root rentention. 
<br/><br/>
THX is bringing gamification to the blockchain, running on Polygon, where their API allows for easily embedded blockchain powered gamification in any application. Their focus is particularly centred around strengthening DAO communities through gamification, specifically when it comes to voting, money management and use cases around loyalty programs. 
<br/><br/>
They also currently have discord integration compatibility— highly relevant for a lot of DAOs building their communities today. </span></p>
      <p className={styles.text28}>NFTags<br/>
<span className={styles.text29}>After the NFT rush earlier this year many of us became acquainted with NFTs as natively digital assets that only exist online. However, their application potential expands far wider, </span></p>
      <p className={styles.text30}>and in fact has some of the most promise when it comes to the intersection between the digital and physical— where NFTs are able to streamline and transparently reconcile the ledger of goods between these two realms. This afterall is a large component of materialising the metaverse. 
      <br/><br/>
NFTags is building at this very intersection through the creation of secured NFC tags that can be scanned to then display information about the connection of that physical item & NFC to the minted NFT on the blockchain. The project is still in its early days and there have been a number of similar protocols developed around this area in the past 3-4 years. It will be interesting to see how they bring new innovation to this space through experimenting with the interchange of the digi-physical and what this could mean for users being able to interface with DAOs, social tokens, DeFi DAPPs and also blockchain gaming infrastructure. </p>
      <p className={styles.text31}>KOTAL<br/>
<span className={styles.text32}>The open source alternative to Infura— Kotal is an API gateway for deploying self managing blockchain infrastructure. Anything from Ethereum 2 beacon and validation nodes to Filecoin nodes and private Ethereum networks. It’s cloud agnostic, running on any public or private cloud that supports Kubernetes and it allows for key reuseability across multiple blockchain nodes and networks.</span></p>
