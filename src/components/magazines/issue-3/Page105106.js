      <p className={styles.text1}>This kills the intermediary. Smart contracts can be developed to match customers. There’s entirely no need for a couple of strangers heading down to the bank branch to borrow or to lend and the bank to essentially match the lender with the borrower on top of a hefty fee. The smart contract enables the lender to deposit their money directly on the blockchain for the borrower to withdraw under a predetermined set of criteria baked into the code.

DeFi use cases are growing exponentially, ranging from options trading platforms, lending protocols, prediction markets, decentralized exchanges, liquidity mining protocols, stablecoins, and payment integrations, among others.
<br/><br/>
DeFi empowers the user to take the basic elements of the financial markets and its existing infrastructure, which includes credit activities or transactions like exchanging and settlements through software that runs entirely on the internet, devoid of any institutional baggage that CeFi markets invariably have baked in.
<br/><br/>
For instance, a crypto holder could theoretically place funds into a decentralized lending protocol like Aave to earn interest at significantly higher rates than your garden variety savings account could ever give—but with consequently greater risk.
<br/><br/>
But on a more concrete level: how can you make money with DeFi right now?
<br/><br/>
Making bank with DeFi<br/>
There are more than a few ways to skin a cat, and there are just as many ways to make bank in DeFi.
<br/><br/>
Liquidity Pools<br/>
And it all starts with one of its fundamental technologies that make up DeFi as we know it today: liquidity pools. Liquidity pools power credit (borrow/lend) protocols, yield farming, automated market makers, synthetic derivatives, and insurance, among several new applications. They drive almost every facet of DeFi and will remain to do so in the coming years.
<br/><br/>
The premise is simple: liquidity pools are basically a pool of funds put together in a permissionless environment where any individual can add or remove liquidity. And it is the basis of numerous iterations for generating yield.
<br/><br/>
One of the most well-known iterations of DeFi is yield farming. Liquidity pools comprise the backbone of the Yearn yield-generating platform, where individuals can deposit their funds into pools used to generate yield for every participant.</p> 
      <p className={styles.text2}>It’s always been a tricky proposition for crypto projects to be distributing new tokens to the right individuals, and liquidity mining has since been one of the more sustainable approaches. In essence, liquidity mining works by distributing tokens to those who deposit their crypto assets into a liquidity pool. The new tokens are then distributed algorithmically to each individual’s corresponding stake in the pool algorithmically.
      <br/><br/>
These tokens can also be in the form of other tokens like Uniswap (if you are a liquidity provider). Consequently, you will be able to deposit such tokens into other pools to repeat the process and earn returns on your investment.
<br/><br/>
We could also think about governance as a use case. In some cases, there’s a very high threshold of token votes needed to be able to put forward a formal governance proposal. If the funds are pooled together instead, participants can rally behind a common cause they deem important for the protocol.
<br/><br/>
Governance<br/>
Governance is yet another use case for liquidity pools. Some protocols require a high threshold of token votes to formulate a proper governance proposal. When funds are pooled together, individuals can garner and unite over a particular cause that they may determine as critical for the protocol.
<br/><br/>
Tranching and synthetic assets<br/>
Yet another use for liquidity pools is tranching, or what involves separating and categorizing financial products depending on their risk and return profiles. Such products allow liquidity pools to choose one.
<br/><br/>
Synthetic assets such as those that are pegged to a particular asset are also dependent on liquidity pools in order for them to be minted on-chain. These are essentially akin to traditional financial derivatives that derive their value from other assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, precious metals, or currencies to trade them without necessarily holding the real asset.
<br/><br/>
DeFi-ning appeal<br/>
Since May 2020, the total value locked in DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Compound, Maker, and Aave ballooned from a shade under $1 billion to do an 88x—or $88 billion in total locked value in the entire space—at its very peak last May 2021. Annual percentage yields have skyrocketed through the roof as users began to engage in yield farming as fast as they can. That’s a far cry from the minuscule APYs on a basic savings account. </p>
