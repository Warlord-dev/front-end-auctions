My key skill is the ability to use and combine multiple softwares, allowing myself to explore different areas of the CGI field, with a strong objective-driven attitude.

After 12+ years’ experience in virtual worlds and 5+ years into VFX for the cinema industry, I founded in 2018 the "Fabeeo Breen" brand:

      <p className={styles.text11}>My most go-to resources are Pinterest, Unsplash, Wired, National Geographic, Google Scholar, NASA, and many more. I usually gather many more visuals to establish a mood board. Every time I look at the board, I keep deleting the images that seem repetitive or out of place. It is not an exact science, but it helps to keep focused. To my students I usually tell them to not </p> 
      <p className={styles.text12}>use more than 6 images and 5 colors. Additionally, I tell them to refrain from putting smartphone designs in a mood board. It is often not as inspiring and can lead to accidental generic copying. I find textures and non-related imagery often unlocks far more creativity than just taking reference from a similar object as to what you aspire your final design to be.</p>
