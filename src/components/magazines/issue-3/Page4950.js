      <p className={styles.text1}>Why DeFi? 
In many ways, much of what drives the DeFi ecosystem’s unprecedented growth is tied to the inherently flawed, inadequate, or fragile systems of monolithic, centralized, and traditional “big finance.”
<br/><br/>
Such historical inefficiencies are responsible for the operational risks we associate with finance, such as fraud, data breaches, white-collar crime, and its undesirable ilk.
<br/><br/>
The decentralized manner in which DeFi operates seeks to correct the operational risks associated with conventional finance.
<br/><br/>
DeFi’s increasing popularity has offered tremendous potential in correcting the pitfalls of traditional finance as far as access to banking and financial services is concerned. With over 2 billion individuals currently without access to either, it’s tantalizing to think how DeFi might be able to empower billions to take control of their finances without all the hoops they need to jump through to get served—while participating in an inclusive, antifragile industry that can potentially generate the income needed to improve their financial situation.
<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, DeFi offers a more customized, flexible user experience for the rest of the banked population, giving them access to the same products and services (if not strictly better ones) and giving them the reps they need to understand the basics of finance.
<br/><br/>
DeFi operationalizes the basic tenets of blockchain decentralization as applied to a spectrum of banking and financial services, made possible by developing dapps built on its public infrastructure.
<br/><br/>
And DeFi posits a plausible solution to the constantly widening gap in the distribution of wealth among the nations—which was essentially a direct result of the centralized, circuitous, and monolithic nature of the financial services industry. DeFi is just the disruption the industry needs to remediate the age-old problem of economic inequality, which is itself rooted in the nature of the financial beast.
<br/><br/>
The tantalizing promise of DeFi
DeFi posits a decentralized alternative built on the principles of fairness, inclusivity, openness, anonymity, and transparency. There’s no endless cabal of repugnant and pompous intermediaries to deal with to make your hard-earned money work for you. There’s no “install this app and register to use our services so we can sell you more things you don’t need.” Peter doesn’t need to go through arduous KYC processes to pay Paul. There are no ridiculous barriers to entry to participate—social/industry clout, wealth, and location be damned. In DeFi, inclusion, fairness, and equity are real.
<br/><br/>
DeFi is the antithesis of traditional finance. Here’s why:
<br/><br/>
DeFi is permissionless. Anyone with an internet connection can access DeFi apps. There’s no KYC, there’s no endless bureaucracy, and there are no credit checks. There are no gatekeepers—users get to directly interact with DeFi smart contracts on blockchain protocols straight from their wallets.
DeFi is trustless. No centralized authority needs to be trusted to guarantee the validity of transactions.
DeFi is transparent. DeFi dapps are built on transparent, immutable, and auditable blockchains, primarily Ethereum.
DeFi is programmable. Unlike traditional finance, where any innovation, creation, or development needs to go through layers and layers of complex rules, regulations, and obstacles, DeFi devs can engineer, combine, and freely put together financial services of their choice at a substantially lesser cost. Just like Lego pieces can be composed, so are DeFi applications.
DeFi is resistant to censorship. No centralized authority can reverse transactions, nor can some gormless, faceless corporation allow or deny services to anyone.
DeFi is efficient. </p>  
      <div className={styles.image2}></div>
      <p className={styles.text2}>The hallmark characteristic of smart contracts on Ethereum, for instance, has a wide spectrum of old and new financial services baked into Turing-complete code instead of a teller, clerk, or corporate drone. This means very little, if any, to pay the piper.
      <br/><br/>
DeFi is poised to trigger the proverbial paradigm shift as the broader technological revolution powered by constantly increasing smartphone use and internet connectivity across all swathes of the global economy, developing or otherwise, and as the towers of crypto and blockchain combine. Furthermore, as adoption increases and spreads and new digital worlds emerge from the stranglehold of web2, DeFi is integral to the metaverse equation, as it underpins the financial backbone of the metaversal economy—not to mention a truly global digital banking and financial revolution.
<br/><br/>
DeFi and its various services
DeFi leverages blockchain technologies, all of which have non-DeFi use cases, that are nevertheless prerequisites within the realm of DeFi. Here are some of the primary services available in the DeFi realm.
<br/><br/>
Stablecoins. Stablecoins serve as the bridge between fiat and crypto, and are therefore fundamental to DeFi. They were intended to retain a largely consistent value, typically denominated in USD or other fiat currencies. For instance, Dai, issued by MakerDAO, is a collateral-backed stablecoin pegged to the dollar. Dai, like other stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), is a key ingredient to the DeFi formula. The scope of Dai’s adoption makes it one of the most utilized products in the crypto sphere.
<br/><br/>
MakerDAO is an Ethereum-based protocol that issues the Dai stablecoin that facilitates collateral-backed loans without an intermediary. The platform allows borrowers to use unstable cryptocurrencies into Dai.
<br/><br/>
Credit. Whenever individuals need a line of credit for any reason, the first place they go to is their bank. DeFi disintermediates that by enabling anyone to be a lender. DeFi credit involves creating interest-bearing financial products that must be fully amortized, and aligning both lenders and borrowers to facilitate their issuance. Aave is a non-custodial protocol allowing users to borrow assets and generate income on deposits.
<br/><br/>
Derivatives. These are sophisticated financial transactions that go beyond the definition of lending, which could be based on a function of a particular asset (or group thereof). Their value can be based on practically anything from the outcome of an event, to the value of a stock, commodity, or digital asset based on current or future prices. In the context of DeFi, derivatives service providers match buyers and sellers and backed collateral pools that are incentivized.
Synthetix is an Ethereum-based decentralized platform developed for synthetic asset issuance. The platform allows users to gain exposure to on-chain synthetic assets that track the prices of digital assets, stocks, commodities, currencies, and indices.
<br/><br/>
Decentralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges allow traders to exchange one digital asset for another. DeFi exchanges often use decentralized order books or by algorithmically setting prices and matching orders.
UniSwap is a fully decentralized automated market maker whose on-chain protocol facilitates transactions between tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of order books, UniSwap utilizes liquidity pools.
Insurance. DeFi insurance services are centered on mitigating risks directly to decentralized finance, such as hacks, smart contract failures. In the event of a covered scenario analogous to any of the above, these services offer protection by offering a trade between a huge lump-sum payment in exchange for a monthly premium.
<br/><br/>
Union Protocol offers DeFi participants a wide array of coverage against a number of risks related to smart contracts.
Asset management. The emergence of DeFi asset management tools, infrastructure, and creators drastically reduced the barrier of entry to many investors who couldn’t have participated otherwise in traditional finance, as well as investors who have never gotten a chance to do so for whatever reason—in a transparent, trustless manner.
<br/><br/>
Yearn.finance is a group of protocols designed to help users make the most out of their earnings on crypto assets through credit services and trades. Yearn offers community-driven yield farming vaults, among other asset management services.</p>
