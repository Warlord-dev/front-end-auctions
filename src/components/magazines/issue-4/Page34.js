        Right now I’m making a giant remix of everything that has come before and everything that is 
        to come after. Right now I’m playing with these time crystals. I’m in this liminal place 
        between where I’ve been and where I’m going, and I’m putting everything on the line. It might 
        feel a little uncomfortable sometimes, even a little scary. But the truth is, this doesn’t 
        really bother me too much. In fact, I’m kind of addicted to it. I’m sticking with it. This is 
        an all in game. A half-hearted spirit has no power. Because I know exactly what direction I’m 
        headed and who’s chosen to come along for the ride. It’s a ride filled with intense passion. 
        And something good is happening.
        <br />
        <br />
        As we cultivate this new phase of matter it’s easy to get pulled into a gravity well of 
        collapsing paridigms and tempt drifting past the event horizon. Because being content with how 
        things are is how we slip into an area of low mass, there’s nothing to bump into or push off from. 
        It’s a grey zone of rebalancing. There’s no clash to stir up catalysts of new innovation and new 
        hope. Again and again for many this slow fade into inertia just keeps repeating. 
        <br />
        <br />
        So where does a real spark come from? Where is the magic beans moment that against all odds 
        carries us up and out. It certainly doesn’t come from brute force or persistant logic. Instead, 
        the champion moment can be instigated through our selective ability to hit the magic reset button.
        Because the past is never where you think that you left it. This is a tool that allows us to bypass 
        irrational fantasies and skip right to the good stuff. The post select. We can shape our desires and
        realities even as they shape us. This isn’t simply a matter of delicate interpretation. It’s how 
        the complete spread from our neurons to the encompassing universe work. Backwards causation gives a
        broader perspective. We zoom out in order to zoom in. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Fortunately, decentralised tech in commerce gives us these kind of super post selecting powers, where 
        we can build around a core itterable loop of economic activity that creates wealth in the core of 
        the entire mechanism, gaining time, space and greater tranformational ability as the friction points 
        of the system are radically reduced and our ability to communicate, transact, trade, buy, sell, wear 
        generously compounds on the fundamental value collectively generated. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Decentralised Commerce is not just about moving goods from one point to another. It’s much more than 
        that. It fosters and encourages fundamental breakthroughs of economic, creative and financial power 
        so that we can proactively shape our present, no longer constrained but rather amplified by the past. 
        For there are many kinds of magic, after all.
