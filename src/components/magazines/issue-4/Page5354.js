        If you told somene not very long ago that playing games all day could do anyone any good rather than square eyes for life and crippling thumbs, they would have been likely to smirk at best or regaled you about your moral weakness. With the rise of esports and alternate gaming monetisation pathways like Twitch streaming and Youtube video virality, this began to change. Is it really just a ponzi scheme or mass global sweatshop with an addictive interface, padding the pockets of AAA gaming companies. Here's the thing though, without ownership of your time, effort and the assets you generate, pretty much everything in the economy is a ponzi sweatshop hybrid. It's just packaged differently.

        And that's the big question here. Is the current P2E models available really P2E? Is new value, knowledge, skill really being generated? Because it's not just about establishing a new way to earn income through crypto. It's so much more than that. True wealth catalysts need to grow more than just a balance sheet and reshuffling of value. They must also coincide with increased productive capacity. And this doesn't come from just repetitive pressing of a dopamine release button, because we already have slot machines for that. But rather, it's about generating novelty, enabling anyone with gamified tools so that they can become their own wealth catalysts and meta-combinators.  They are able to take simple inputs and connect dots for ingenious outputs as a collective, whether they recognise it as more than traditional gaming or not.

        The Philippines has been one of the largest economies to be taken by storm with P2E. Their population extends to approximately 108 million people and of this almost 1% of the population is leveraging P2E as a significnat source for their income. In fact, 60% ofAxie Infinity players are from the Philippines.

        During the pandemic unemployment rates skyrocketed in the Philippines hitting over 40%. The minimum wage also in this region is around USD$170 per month with poverty rampant and few other alternatives available. It’s no wonder that so many have jumped at this new opportunity. But it’s even bigger than that, it proves out the P2E concept as a real replacement for more traditional economies on their last legs.
