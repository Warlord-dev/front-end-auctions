        Just last August, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos officially became the richest individual in the world, with a fortune exceeding that of oil and resource-rich Qatar’s gross domestic product—or roughly over $210 billion. It’s the largest known fortune in existence today.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Ever since Amazon launched in 1994, Bezos’ grand vision for Amazon was to become the preeminent all-encompassing marketplace the likes of which had never been seen before. And it’s already come to fruition. Bezos made his bones building Amazon into the multibillion-dollar powerhouse that it is, much in line with his goal of creating the only marketplace people would ever need.
        <br /><br />
        Since then, Amazon has constantly broken new highs and reached new milestones, as it has dominated and cornered entire markets, as they aggressively pursue the creation of an entire ecosystem built around its e-commerce platform that traverses every sphere of our economic lives.        
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        Each year, Amazon achieves new heights—dominating entire industries, dipping its fingers into logistics, cloud computing, live streaming, artificial intelligence, all the way to financial services, relentlessly pushing the envelope on expanding its virtual stranglehold on commerce through constant market tinkering while throwing its ample weight around as the undisputed 600-pound gorilla of the Commerce 2.0 jungle.
        <br /><br />
        Let’s put it this way—it’s not Santa’s Little Elves who ensure you get your next purchase within 2 days. Rather, the retail giant fulfills orders through its vast network of fulfillment centers scattered across the globe, where hundreds of thousands of employees work tirelessly in downright exploitative circumstances.
        <br /><br />
        As 19th century French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac was once reported to have quipped: behind every great fortune is an equally great crime. And to the myriad ex-Amazon employees who have had to take piss breaks in bottles in a toxic workplace where productivity is measured by the literal minute—the Amazon bigwig has a lot to account for. Namely, the obscene fact that a man making almost $4000 a second can’t do anything to raise the company’s $15 minimum wage to a reasonable, acceptable standard—even as Amazon made record sales in the middle of the worst pandemic in recent history.
        <br /><br />
        This wasn’t lost on disgruntled Amazon ex-employees that rolled out a prop guillotine outside Bezos’ mansion, calling for his head figuratively (if not literally) the day after the news about Bezos’ becoming the wealthiest man alive came out. The same ones that helped build Amazon to the retail powerhouse that it is—the salt of the earth that runs the whole damn fulfillment layer.
        <br /><br />
        It’s understandable why there would be some outrage over the whole shebang, particularly when Bezos went to space and put his foot in his mouth thanking every Amazon employee and customer for subsidizing his intergalactic joyride on Blue Origin.
        <br /><br />
        We can all play armchair quarterback endlessly about the semantics of his expression of gratitude. But in light of the labor conditions that Amazon rank and file go through, as well as its corporate culture and reports of unethical practices, it came across as a bad joke.

        It’s also a textbook case of how a once-beloved startup that grew big and lived long enough to see itself become the villain—like most of the Commerce 2.0 stalwarts like Walmart, eBay, and Etsy have become.
        <br /><br />
        Amazon, which once operated out of a nondescript house in Washington state, has become such a dominant force in online retail that it has a virtual monopoly on e-commerce–thought to be as much as over 50% of the market. But you don’t become the world’s richest man without stepping on anybody else’s toes, and that fact is not lost on the millions looking for a better solution than Amazon.
        <br /><br />
        For years, Bezos has employed predatory pricing tactics to pound the competition into submission using its vast reserves of resources. Amazon didn’t turn a profit until 7 years after its inception in 2001, practically built its wealth on undercutting prices, bullying third-party sellers into using their platform, and extracting resources from governments in the United States and the rest of the world. It’s the Silicon Valley™ way: burn through capital in order to buy their way into success. Customers may benefit from lower prices in the short-term. But ultimately, monopolists care fuck all about the employees.
        <br /><br />
        Amazon, for the longest time, was exempted from sales tax in many states until a few years ago, and its overreliance on remote fulfillment centers, abject working conditions, and minimum wage labor guarantees that the profit margins are fully maximised to the hilt.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn’t get better for third-party sellers on Amazon, either—apart from the cost of Amazon FBA, which isn’t exactly a pittance, the ultimate cost of becoming part of the Amazon Death Star was the commoditization of a brand and its products within its walled gardens (*coofs* Apple *coofs*).
        <br /><br />
        Merchants have no ownership of their brand, and become one of the thousands of faceless brands that Amazon itself competes directly against by privately labeling and distributing its own white-label versions of the best-selling products at much lower overhead than its third-party sellers could. It doesn’t matter if your company is in fashion, electronics, food and beverage, or consumables—Amazon is likely competing against you underneath your nose, using the same predatory tactics. Go against the TOS for any perceived wrongthink or violation? Get yeeted.
        <br /><br />
        The undeniable truth is that private companies and multibillionaires can do as they please—and their attempts at dick-waving and subsequent kowtowing by the subservient media to them are abundantly clear. All is fair in love and capitalism.
        <br /><br />
        But there is an alternative to the excesses of Web and Commerce 2.0 and its inevitable overreach into every aspect of our lives, including commerce: decentralisation.
        <br /><br />
        The crux of the biscuit is that no one man, consortium, or corporation should have all that power to single-handedly dictate the way we conduct commerce. And the decentralisation of the online marketplaces and public spaces users frequent offer a way to empower them and give them the agency to decide their own fate–particularly the ones that don’t have the same access to the vast financial and infrastructural resources these e-commerce giants possess.
