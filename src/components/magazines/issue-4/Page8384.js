      Originally a substitute on Team Kongdoo for Fissure, Void has proved his way to the top, and now considered one of the most skilled in the Overwatch League. He’s set his path competing with the Shanghai Dragons and still with plenty ahead to achieve, but at this rate, it appears the best is yet to come.

        Snip3rdown is no greenhorn. He is one of the most successful players in Halo esports history, with almost 13 years of competitive record up his sleeve— 24x Halo champion and 2x xGame medalist. One of his most notable traits however has been the steady positive endurance that he’s maintained since his beginnings in the industry. He emphasises keeping a positive outlook, addressing weaknesses, and focusing on mental preparation before any match— something that is often all too overlooked when it comes to elite athlete performance.

        coinfund leading 2.3 million investment

      <div className={styles.text14}>
        CoinFund is powering the next wave of crypto x esports, leading a $2.3 million investment round going towards building out a new blockchain gaming community platform that will allow players to organise video game tournaments, integrated with instant crypto reward payouts.
        <br /><br />
        Often noted as a gateway for crypto mass adoption, the gaming industry has been picking up web3 speed as of late, particularly when it comes to the integration of NFTs to verify the ownership of in-game assets. CoinFund’s platform plans to also experiment further with NFTs for esports. But rather than just a ledger of player inventory, esports presents a unique opportunity for accelerating new influencer content monetisation models, allowing players to spin up unique only-fans style NFT drops targeted at fans, followers and industry die hards.

        XQC Fights back
      </div>
      
      <div className={styles.text17}>
        xQc is one of Twitch’s most popular players, but also, according to the platform, most controversial. He recently received another ban from Twitch when he streamed the Olympics for one of his “reaction videos”. It seems a bit extensive to issue a DMCA over something like this. But more than that it points to a deeper rot within the industry of destroying new talent out of fear that someone doing organic marketing for you for free will somehow diminish your brand value.

        activision bans more than 60,000 cod accounts

      <div className={styles.text19}>
        Setting a new record for mass user account bans, Activision Blizzard barred 60,000 Call of Duty Warzone accounts in the same day earlier this year admist major cheating accounts. Keeping a game community fairly governered with balanced mechanics is important for maintaining the core love for the gameplay. However, it poses an interesting question for blockchain games; is it only the interface that will ban the players in the onset of permissionless protocols?
