        By 2022, global e-commerce sales are expected to be worth more than a staggering $5.4 trillion. E-commerce accounted for 18% of all worldwide sales last year, and it’s constantly increasing by substantial year-on-year volumes. It’s massive. It’s evident to any entrepreneur worth their salt that online is the way to go if they want their business to grow.
        <br /><br />
        It’s obvious what the benefits are for sellers on e-commerce platforms—they allow them to adjust to customer’s expectations and purchasing habits. Everybody’s buying something online. You need to align with your clients if you are to succeed—as fickle as they could be. 
        <br /><br />
        The next reason is to expand your client base. E-commerce is borderless, and your garden-variety brick-and-mortar needs a buyer to actually pop in.
        <br /><br />
        Literally anybody can put up a store in seconds. Everything is standardized nowadays, with more than a few platforms to use pre-approved marketplace templates and get the show on the road within a few hours on Shopify. Alternatively, you can set up a merchant account on Amazon and begin listing your inventory within minutes. It’s so easy to start selling online at any capacity.
        <br /><br />
        All well and good. But we do know that things are never as cut-and-dried as they seem. 
        <br /><br />
        That’s because every merchant will be familiar with the problem child of every online purchase—that of the traditional online payment systems that constrain them due to jurisdictional obstacles that differ from country to country.
        <br /><br />
        Traditional online payments like credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, Stripe, and their ilk.

      <div className={styles.rect2}></div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        Therein lies the rub—because the very system that enables entrepreneurs to reach new markets, clients, and customers are the same ones that weigh them down. Payment processors on the other hand are a constant source of friction for merchants.
        <br /><br />
        It’s a shambles. Online payment systems evolve at the speed of a glacier—and they run antithetical to the industry they claim to support.
        <br /><br />
        Hear me out a second.
        <br /><br />
        New sellers generate lower volumes—and payment processors will only be too happy to part you from your money on constantly increasing prices like a noose tightening around sellers’ necks. Survive if they let you. 
        <br /><br />
        Low volume sellers naturally have no history, and if you plan to sell across borders, you will pay far out the ass on fees. E-commerce platforms want you to grow, but payment processors are seriously weighing you down with sundries left and right. 
        <br /><br />
        Domestic transactions tack on an additional 3-5% in intermediary fees. That isn’t chump change.
        <br /><br />
        Then, another problem inherent in payments are chargebacks, or reversals in favour of the client. These pesky happenstances can occur for legitimate reasons as a result of a glitch in the supply chain matrix, where a merchant couldn’t fulfil an order for any reason. Most of the time, however, chargebacks are fraud-related, meaning a customer couldn’t recognize a payment or their credit card was stolen. That’s wasted time, money, and resources—in the form of lost revenue, a luxury new sellers can ill afford—and that doesn’t exactly paint a bright picture on their brand’s reputation. That’s not to mention the turnaround time with which international payments can be settled, which can take over a week to complete in some cases.
        <br /><br />
        It’s utterly contradictory.
