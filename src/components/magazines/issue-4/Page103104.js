        The litany of rent-seeking middlemen extracting their pound of flesh for putting two and two together profit from the value of trust—whether processing payments across borders, processing remittances, linking buyers and sellers, or keeping your personally identifiable information safe. Trust is the bedrock of commerce, and decentralised trust systems can perform that mechanism at an infinitely lower cost than another centralised regulatory organ or agency. Moreover, projects engaged in decentralised commerce allow them to pass their savings to their users, therefore providing greater scalability—towards building an open, completely transparent, non-exploitative, less extractive infrastructure for conducting global business.
        <br /><br />
        Nevertheless, there is yet plenty of work lying ahead to realise the vision of a decentralised manner of conducting commerce, but the tools that could enable its construction already exist, and it’s reasonably hardened enough to take the show on the road and hit the big time. Decentralisation is starting to gain traction as the antidote to Big Tech’s overreach on its predatory model of

        exploiting their users’ privacy by spying on their online habits and swiping their personal information (often without their consent) to sell them more products and services. It’s increasingly being seen as the antidote to the poison of this exploitative and manipulative system.
        <br /><br />
        Additionally, trends dictate the winds of commerce. We’ve seen this with the increased demand from fair-trade products, greater ownership of customer data, and the rising sense of cynicism and distrust for faceless corporations—all of which flow into the unquestionably unique value proposition that DeCo possesses.
        <br /><br />
        Decentralisation’s impact on commerce will redefine the way we conduct business entirely like the rest of the world marches onwards to a digital, decentralised global economy.
        <br /><br />
        E-commerce, as we know it today, is slow. Transactions are a convoluted mess passed around like a hot potato across non-interoperable payment gateways, a cross-section of digital storefronts, and a network of banks, all of which process information in their unique ways. One misstep at any step of the circuitous process throws a spanner in the works.

        The beauty of Web 3.0 is that its solutions are endlessly interoperable. They can be iterated in as many ways as it could support DeCo’s ultimate goal: an open, fair, and transparent way of exchanging products and services, one where its stakeholders benefit along with the ecosystem that enables it, not to mention one that incentivises them to act in line with its long-term objectives, rather than merely the size of their shareholders’ dividends and their directors’ fat bonuses.
        <br /><br />
        Information is asymmetrical among stakeholders in a traditional centralized and non-standardized supply chain. Buyers don’t know where their suppliers source their products. Suppliers don’t know where manufacturers obtain their raw materials. Every stakeholder is left to their own devices as far as managing data is concerned.
