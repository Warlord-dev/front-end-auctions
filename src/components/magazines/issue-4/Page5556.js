        Axie Infinity, today’s star pupil in play to earn. IT’S BEGUN TO TRANSFORM THE ECONOMY OF THE PHILIPPINES, WHEREBY AT ANY ONE TIME OVER 60% OF ACTIVE PLAYERS OF THE GAME CALL THIS REGION HOME. 
        <br /><br />
        sitting down with axie cofounder, Jiho, IT’S CLEAR THAT IT’S SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE AXIE PLAYER COUNT THAT IS GOING UP, BUT RATHER AN ENTIRE MATURING DIGITAL LAYER THAT IS being stiched together through every trade and interaction here, made from the byproducts of previous, more capitve economic eras, and accerating how quickly we all move beyond them.

        We will see new nations form out of digital economies, complete with their own systems of governance and property rights. Trust in traditional institutions is collapsing and digitally native economies will fill the power vacuums that form. The metaverse will be somewhere that we can live, work, and play. P2E will attract hundreds of millions of dreamers to digital economies.

        TO GO BEYOND THE WORDS ON THIS PAGE WE SENT ONE OF OUR OWN UNDERCOVER INTO THE AXIEVERSE.  this black ops mission didn’t go down without a battle and some cute little axies joining for the ride.

      <div className={styles.text4}>
        “We had two bags of axs, 4500 pellets of slp, five mystic Statues of Nægling, a basket of wild flowers combined with an oil lamp, and a whole collection of poisonous vases... and also a quart of bonzai trees, a quart of ice buckets, a case of pink lavenders, a pint of raw warbler nests and two dozen wingboots. Not that we needed all that for this undercover journey, but once you get locked into a serious axie battle, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.”
