        We’ve seen that happen when web2 democratised information, revolutionised commerce, and changed publishing as we knew it. Communities were reshuffled and galvanised, missions and visions were recalibrated, and massive value was generated borne from the synergies and creative links that the technology itself brings.
        <br /><br />
        History is repeating itself with web3. 
        <br /><br />
        And the signs are pointing towards the ultimate fragmentation—or unbundling, as it were—of Amazon and the Commerce 2.0 giants just as the web2 sails the inexorable tide to web3.
        <br /><br />
        NFTs, for instance, have come to represent new forms of exchanging value and conducting decentralised commerce. 
        <br /><br />
        The layer of value that NFTs add to the DeCo equation make the prospects of a truly decentralised manner of commerce tantalising—a trustless, peer-to-peer system of value exchange serving as a direct affront to the pervasive gatekeeping inherent in traditional commerce.
        <br /><br />
        E-commerce’s dealbreakers of exorbitant commissions, unethical labor practices, insanely high barriers to entry, incessant middlemanning, and payment processing friction can all be settled with decentralisation.
        <br /><br />
        #DeCo is the ultimate solution to extricating business from the mire that centralisation has left it in.
        <br /><br />
        There will be haters—vested interests of maximalists who could be facing an existential crisis as adoption takes hold. It’s the same lifecycle in commerce, time and time again. The big box stores, malls, and physical retail stores from a seemingly antediluvian past were dragged into e-commerce kicking and screaming, lest they perish. And many did perish.
        <br /><br />
        Decentralisation is simply inevitable at this point as web2 eats itself, and as blockchain protocols, DeFi, DeCo, DAOs, and NFTs are changing the landscape, we all have the agency to choose which side our bread is buttered.

        <span>Yin Finance</span><br/>
        Yin is using NFTs to bring more liquidity to DeFi. They provide a suite of products for liquidity and yield management, whereby NFTs are used within the smart contract architecture to effectively secure a 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        user’s ownership of their unique and personalised treasury and smart vaults. 
        <br/><br/>
        One of these products, CHI, allows users to subscribe to
        programmable strategy NFTs,  whereby YIN designs the LP formula and liquidity strategies from which a user can build upon. This could be something as simple as automatic reinvestments on Uniswap V3 to something more encompassing, like that of combining strategies to short volatility. Either way, it’s another clear way that DeFi composability allows us to put our money to work and see direct rewards from it.

        <span>SAFIENT</span><br/>
        Not your keys, not your coins. One of the most well popularised mantras throughout crypto. But what does that mean for inheritance planning? It’s not a question that a lot of us think about, however, if web3 is to continue to scale and grow then we need to catalyse more engineering and product solutions outside of just larger infrastructure plays.  
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text42}>
        Addressing specialised use cases is important. Real people need to interact with the technology in order for it to increase in adoption. And inheritance planning is a very real undertaking. If we aren’t able to maintain security and ownership over our crypto, whilst at the same time taking into consideration what we would want to happen to it in case of an unfortunate event, then adoption gets  more difficult. 
        <br/><br/>
        Safient is a crypto asset safe and inheritance protocol that helps users securely manage all the critical information that is needed to access and recover the assets so that your loved ones can inherit them with 100% surety incase of any tragic event. It works through the creation of safes on the protocol that ensure you maintain complete access and control over your assets i.e. there is no intermediate custody. Beneficiaries can then be delegated and added to the safe, where they can request access to the funds at any time. Upon request verification and a review is undergone by “trustless safe guardians” from the Kleros decentralised court, ensuring the validity of the claim and resolving transparently any arising disputes.

        <span>treejer</span><br/>
        Treejer is taking climate action and powering it with blockchain technology. The protocol establishes a secure link for wiring payments and crediting ownership between those that fund tree planting with those that plant them— even if that is in really remote geographic locations. 
        <br/><br/>
        These traceable trees enable greater economic inclusion for rural communities, mainly located in underdeveloped and developing countries, where often a lot of the voluntary tree planting takes place. 
        <br/><br/>
        Carbon footprints can now be reduced in a more transparent manner that extends throughout the entire life of the planted tree. The ERC-20 O2 proves the existence of a planted tree, whereby the token is minted at a rate based on allometric equations of each species and verified through oracle groups. It’s a completely new and innovative way of combining economic value with gamified environmental sustainability.

        <span>NIFTY INK</span><br/>
        The open bazaar of NFT art marketplaces— that’s Nifty Ink. It allows anyone to create cool digital art NFTs in a  user friendly prioritised way.  Once created the artwork is minted on the xDAI chain and verified for selling on the Nifty Ink marketplace, with the ability to be bridged to the Ethereum mainnet. Beyond this though, the real innovation of the platform is it’s ease of use and implementation of web2 style trojan horse features. On page load an Ethereum keypair is automatically generated and used to sign transactions for minting any NFTs. Think of it like a quick web wallet so that the Creator can prioritise their art over the complexities of navigating distributed login applications.

        <span>VOODFY</span><br/>
        There are about 122 million daily active users on Youtube and 15 million on Twitch— so it comes at no surprise that the web3 version of these platforms is being built. Voodfy is a decentralised video hosting platform. It’s completely free and supports both audio, video and live streaming. 
        <br/><br/>
        Having more web3 enabled platforms available to creators, beyond the NFT marketplaces that we see in action today, is essential when we think about  properly underwriting the “creative” element of the new creator economy. It’s not enough to just launch social tokens or mint NFTs. Creators need a suite of comprehensive tools at the ready, giving them the productive freedom to form new ingenious combinations and methods for monetising on their content in a way that is personalised to their communities, fans and followers.
