      <p className={styles.text12}>Hamzah Khan Head of DeFi Polygon </p>
      <p className={styles.text10}>Can you introduce yourself. How did you get involved with Polygon and the crypto/DeFi space in general?</p>
      <p className={styles.text11}>Hey everyone, I am Hamzah. I come from an engineering background, started my career writing code for Citibank R&D but soon started looking into startups. Worked in Dubai for a year in startups, running some software consultancy gigs myself until Fall ‘21. Although I had gotten into crypto during college in 2017, but it was only in ‘21 when I genuinely got into the space buying some crypto like everyone else. But I quickly moved on-chain after reading about DeFi and all the legos it had like Uniswap, Compound etc. Soon I realised that to better understand the space I needed some experience and Polygon at the time was a perfect opportunity to kickstart things.</p>
      <p className={styles.text13}>Can you tell us a bit more about Polygon and what this new Layer 2 infrastructure means for DeFi?</p>
      <p className={styles.text14}>Sure. Polygon is an Ethereum scaling solution with 2 solutions already in production - Plasma chain and PoS commit chain. Our founders were core contributors to the Plasma research group back in 2018 when the first Ethereum congestion occurred. It was the dawn of Cryptokitties. Since then PoS chain launched, which today holds over 6B in TVL and over 500 dapps across DeFi, NFTs and Gaming.
<br/><br/>
A Layer 2 space is extremely important if DeFi has to hit mainstream. We currently have over 2.5M wallets which roughly means less than 1M actual users. Thats 0.1% of a billion smart phones out there which DeFi can disrupt. Polygon’s mission with scaling </p>
      <p className={styles.text15}>solutions is to bring #DeFiForAll. To facilitate this, you can see most of the Ethereum blue-chips have moved to Polygon to reach retail users and their DAOs are earning more revenue than the L1 market. Its a clear product market fit. </p>
      <p className={styles.text16}>A large caveat still with DeFi and also Layer 2’s in general is the lack of simplicity in the user onboarding. Yield farming, changing RPC’s etc. are still very new terms and actions for a lot of newcomers wanting to get into web3 and start taking the reins for gaining the full potential in their own lives, not reliant on or stopped by a middleman. How do you see Polygon supporting more adoption and onboarding of DeFi so that it can truly reach the billions of people that it should? </p>
      <p className={styles.text17}>This is definitely a difficult problem to solve. Its a gradual process which will take years and many communities to work together and evangelise on this front. 
Polygon is working actively to increase mobile wallet support - a major UX improvement to onboard next million users. We have jointly put up a DAO with 0x Project of $10M which can be utilized by developers to build DeFi tooling, products and infra on Polygon to ease usage. RPCs certainly was an issue earlier but with Infura and Chainstack support, things are more reliable. I would suggest to signup with any of the above providers to use a dedicated plan. Its free of charge, much better than public RPCs. Also we are working with Alchemy to have a dedicated load balancing RPC that can help in times of resource crunch. 
There’s also void in DeFi education space - if anyone’s building content around that. We are happy to help. 
</p>
      <p className={styles.text18}>We all heard about the Titan project collapse on Polygon, and this especially gained more attention due to Mark Cuban ape’ing into the project. Of course this was no relation to or fault of the Polygon team, but how do you feel in general about a lot of the meme coin and quick gains / pump and dump projects coming into DeFi? Is this something that people should be jumping into for a quick high risk profit or is it something that they should be staying far away from? </p>
      <p className={styles.text19}>Iron particularly was more of an economical exploit. The way these algorithmic stablecoins   grow so rapidly is by giving high emissions on the seniorage token (TITAN in this case). Thereby reducing collateral ratio of the stablecoin and releasing a ton of TITAN in the market. Certain whales start tweeting about their LPs and gains - seemed to be an exit liquidity event for earlier whales, whilst being a FOMO event for newbies. When this happens, whales dump on the noobs and with TITAN being dumped upon them - broke IRON peg and things deflated very quickly. 
      <br/><br/>
People have to understand DeFi is still a very risky endeavour, especially if it’s not a blue chip project like AAVE or Curve. I understand where you are coming from and totally agree on the bad optics that goes out. Polygon is a permissionless blockchain - we can’t censor or stop projects from building here even if we wanted to. It’s technically impossible. Investors should read the documentations, ask the community in telegram/discord etc about loopholes in the economic model and educate themselves before putting in their hard earned money. 
</p>
      <p className={styles.text20}>With what risk appetite should people approach DeFi on Polygon? There is a lot of comments about it being more riskier than DeFi on Ethereum since it’s a Layer 2. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
      <p className={styles.text21}>I am not sure what you mean by “riskier than Ethereum”. Most of Ethereum bluechips like AAVE, Curve, SushiSwap, Kyber, Balancer and many others have chosen Polygon as there scaling solution. We dont endorse or recommend any investments, but these are projects that are battle tested code, reviewed by top teams in the blockchain space and widely respected throughout. As I said, Polygon is still very early in this DeFi phase and we have a long way to go. 
      <br/><br/>
As for Polygon chain’s security, we have over 100 validators that are hosted on Ethereum mainchain. These include some of the most well reputed professional staking firms across all blockchains with over $2B staked.</p>
<p className={styles.text22}>What’s the future of Polygon and DeFi? As Polygon expands further to scale as an entire ecosystem supported by Ethereum as its Layer 1, how do you see more projects being able to leverage off of the new tools and infrastructure being built out? Is there anything specific that people should be paying attention to? </p>
<p className={styles.text23}>The future is difficult to predict since we are a long way into building it. Multichain is definitely a world, many web3 applications like SportX have used the Polygon SDK to build there own chain to scale to a million users. Very interesting concept. Polygon recently launched a data availability solution that fits right into our vision for rollups (optimistic and ZK). This infrastructure will help dapps to scale in ways not possible before. </p>
<p className={styles.text24}>And finally, for a new person wanting to start learning more about Polygon and start taking actions to interact with the network and the different projects and DAPPs built on top of it. Where do they go?
</p>
<p className={styles.text25}>Try with a small amount on top dapps like QuickSwap, AAVE, Curve etc. Play around in a low gas environment before going full pro. Play it safe and learn first.
