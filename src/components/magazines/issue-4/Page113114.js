        Fortunately, decentralisation is releasing the pressure on web2’s stranglehold on the narrative, leading to the sundering of the monoliths that impede the free transfer of value that is waiting to be unlocked.
        <br /><br />
        DeFi – and by extension, DeCo (decentralised commerce) – offers a better alternative to solving the current pitfalls that passion economy participants and platforms alike face. Smart contracts offer a solution to the ever-complex problem of working out a mutually beneficial and scalable compensation and benefits scheme that may involve a lot of wrangling between aligning cash- and equity-based incentives. 
        <br /><br />
        It also provides an on-ramp for participants who wouldn’t otherwise be in crypto a reason to do so by patronising their favourite artists, brands, and entrepreneurs – therefore boosting further crypto adoption.
        <br /><br />
        NFTs take the concept to a whole new level, making the concept of decentralised commerce even closer to fruition by providing the marketplaces, tools, and technology infrastructure needed to turn diffuse elements of post-internet consumption and cultural shifts in behaviour towards something more tangible, something more representative of ownership – immutably recorded on the distributed ledger with finality. NFTs commoditise the clout that is inherent in human nature, which is what everyone should be looking at, rather than the prices that they go for on auction. 
        <br /><br />
        But that’s just scratching the surface of what could be the dawning of a new economic paradigm whose effects and consequences will be far-ranging and volatile, but would definitely hold the key to unlocking the immense value just waiting to be tapped.

        The good news is that there is a tremendous amount of building that’s going on in this space. The race towards developing tools to capture and deliver that elusive delta is materializing, which is probably the most exciting development in web3 thus far. 
        <br /><br />
        The tools are already here, and the results are promising.
        <br /><br />
        Take, for instance, the emergence of decentralised social media platforms such as Rally, Roll and Mirror. Rally and Roll are open networks that allow creators to monetise their communities through the Ethereum blockchain, enabling them to launch their own social token without having to have the requisite development knowledge required. Creators wishing to launch their tokens and build their own economic future based on their own accountability can do so with ease.
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, Mirror.xyz offers a decentralised blockchain platform that seeks to connect audiences with creators who can publish their work and offer them ways to monetise their content directly on-page. 
        <br /><br />
        That’s not to mention the significant difference in take rates – whereas Apple takes 30% of every App Store purchase, YouTube takes 45% of every dollar paid by advertisers. Meanwhile, other platforms like Facebook and TikTok share fuck all. Surprise, surprise!
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, platforms like Rally and Mirror take a minuscule 10% and are otherwise focused on giving back that value to their user base and its creators – the lifeblood of their platforms. 
        <br /><br />
        Contrast that to the literal bones web2 platforms throw to creators, in exchange for original content.
