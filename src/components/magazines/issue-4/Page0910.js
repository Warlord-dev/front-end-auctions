        The explosive growth of decentralised finance, or DeFi, is proof positive of this. DeFi opens the door to anyone with an internet connection and a mobile device to participate in wealth-generating activities, no matter how big or small, through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts essentially take over the functions that financial intermediaries like your brokers and bankers would have, allowing you to make potentially eye-watering returns on your investment—without anyone’s permission.
        <br /><br />
        Well, the same thing is happening with commerce.
      </h1>
      <h2>
        Decentralised commerce, or DeCo, is emerging from the cracks inherent in the centralised structures of Commerce 2.0—the prevailing model of e-commerce as Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay exemplify—and Commerce 1.0, or the physical stores, the Borders, Barnes and Nobles, Best Buys, and all the ruins of the gargantuan malls we used to frequent.
        <br /><br />
        DeCo differentiates itself from DeFi as the former deals with the aspects of commerce such as shopping, invoicing, subscriptions, and payments, while the latter deals with credit, trading, derivatives, and its related subfields.        
      </h2>

      <div className={styles.rectangle}></div>
      <p>
        It is essentially the next logical evolution of Commerce, just as what has been happening in the paradigm shift from web2 to web3. DeCo is Commerce 3.0.
        <br /><br />
        How is it different? Much like web1 and web2, Commerce Mk. I and II were highly centralised, authoritarian structures unilaterally dictating how each aspect of their business is to run. While some provided a degree of autonomy for certain business units or branches to make decisions for themselves, all of those needed the blessing of a central scrutinizer.
        <br /><br />
        Nevertheless, e-commerce has become an inseparable part of our routine. Hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions change hands on an annual basis, and as more individuals gain access to the internet for the very first time, just as the proportion of commercial transactions happening online increases.
        <br /><br />
        The overwhelming majority of this online commerce is carried out through Commerce 2.0 marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba, just to name a few. These platforms offer the service of allowing shoppers to have a universe of goods and services to purchase, all with the convenience of having to use just one website.
