          Why do you think players in the Philippines have taken up the lead in adopting play2earn? Is there something different about the culture, economy, or infrastructure?
          <br/><br/>
          Filipinos have always been a core part of any social network, game or application in the last 20 years. Filipinos are inherently social, speak good English, and love to congregate in groups. This makes them an early adopter of many social networks including Friendster, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, and many game applications.

          How do you think p2e reinforces defi composability and a player building a robust digital identity?
          <br /><br />
          Play-to-earn as a concept is a combination of NFTs (permanent assets that hold value) and Defi (generating yield). Guilds take advantage of composability by purchasing assets in different play-to-earn games and adding value to the game economy by bringing their communities over to these games. Players can express their identity either explicitly (as a cross-world compatible avatar), or implicitly (via on- an off-chain reputation tied to identity).

          How long do you think it will be before the play2earn model becomes a realistic alternative to traditional sources of income in the US and other leading economies?
          <br /><br />
          This will happen in the next 5-10 years where people can start expressing their creativity inside games and virtual worlds that have blockchain-based economies, and people can get paid for their creative work inside of these games.

          What role do you think DAOs will play as gamers form more modern decentralized guilds, merchant houses, and other simplified social structures  as we pioneer new economies in the metaverse
          <br /><br />
          DAOs are a group coordination structure that is a very flexible way to organize people that are working towards a common goal. There will be DAOs of all sizes, structures (such as tokenized vs. non-tokenized) and goals (from the fleeting to world-changing), but the common thread is that DAOs will change the nature of group coordination itself.

          Where’s it going next, beyond p2e, etc, how’s it going to change participation and ownership IRL?
          <br /><br />
          As more and more value shift into the digital world, the notion of what is value itself will permeate back to the physical world. Will luxury goods now have NFTs minted as a certificate of authenticity? Are we going to have house and land titles minted as NFTs on chain, and can be collateralized and composable with Defi? Can I have an NFT representing ownership of my house and then represent that house in an online world such as Cryptovoxels? Only the future can tell!
