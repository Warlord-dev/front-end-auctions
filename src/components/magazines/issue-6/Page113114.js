        Growing Decentralised Communities with Web2 Apps

        The fallout from web2’s master plan of mining personal data about its users is coming full-swing. Social media is sinking, and its users are starting to swim. This, as cancel culture, censorship, de-platforming, constant affronts to privacy, and the wanton disregard for free speech, takes things to an unsurprisingly dystopian end.
        <br /><br />
        The tides are firmly turning against the dinosaurs of web2–and it’s all just a matter of time before a truly open social metaverse powered by web3 comes to fruition.

        It’s no surprise why Mark Zuckerberg is pivoting Facebook, albeit unconvincingly, towards becoming a “metaverse” company. Gag this writer with a spoon.
        <br /><br />
        We already know what these players are all about: they’re all agents of centralization, with profit at heart, rather than the best interests of its participants–nay, their products.
        <br /><br />
        Free speech, privacy, and data security be damned. Authoritarian governments are just around the next node waiting to mine your data for everything it’s worth.
