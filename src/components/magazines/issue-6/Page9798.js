      On getting into music.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text42}>
      In general It was a deep curiosity to understand what exactly was happening as I was listening. I remember reading album lyric booklets and wondering why a certain section was repeated or listening to the radio and asking “what in the world is that sound and how did they make it?” As for my genre there was just something incredible about how it was born and was influenced by multiple genres such as hip hop, Caribbean/tropical and electronic music, it may sound biased but I never heard a genre that blended different sounds and cultures and yet was widely accepted.

    <div className={styles.text43}>
      On web2 music.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text44}>
      Historically my genre has been one of the more centralized and monopolized genres in popular music, its even a common saying within circles and even fans across Puerto Rico and South America, this leaves little room for growth for small and mid-tier artists due to the power of existing and newer gatekeepers. We can argue that with the current system there are more opportunities for discovery and engagement which is true however you are capped at a certain point if you can’t finance your next moves or are extremely connected across platforms that cater specifically towards majors, major Indies, or their respective distribution releases.

      On getting into web3.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text46}>
      My journey in crypto started with Bitcoin in 2013 yet it wasn’t until 2016 where I began developing the premise for a music publishing company in latin music. I found myself searching for an edge through technology, and once again I was led to DLT/blockchain and fell in love with the idea of permanence, transparency of immutable data, real-time tracking and pay outs of royalties via smart contracts.
      <br /><br />
      Early 2017 I discovered Ujo Music, mycelium and I started to truly deep dive into tokenization and NFTs. I used to tell friends about crypto kitties and used it as an analogy as to how the blockchain works but I was looked at as a crazy person haha.
      <br /><br />
      I am also seeing digital artists I’ve collaborated with in the past experience success and it's honestly one of the best parts about the entire space.

      On the future of web3 music.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text48}>
      I am a firm believer in being platform agnostic. I also think platform dependency is a huge liability as we’ve seen with only fans and the recent Facebook outage. I am excited about platforms that enable ownership, discovery and monetization. I think artists should develop a fully vertical strategy in web3 and experiment yet find a way to hyper focus while keeping it user/fan-friendly. I am excited about integrating dynamic and programmable NFTs, it's fascinating. A few other areas include building social capital and community enablement.

      On creating music.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text50}>
      Lately my process has been spontaneous, I love improv as it matches my enthusiasm and real life approach, I have a love-hate relationship with routine and I think that's why my process has developed over the years, I let the muse take hold and release resistance. I draw inspiration from a multitude of genres, it truly is my sound. As a latin artist if you don’t follow the mold you are alternative, if you follow the trend you are generic so I like to play between both worlds.
      <br /><br />
      My creativity increases tenfold when I plan a release as an NFT. It's a good thing but it can get overwhelming at times, less is more. There are similarities such as maintaining a strong sense of branding. The process for Spotify and DSPS is pretty straightforward and the marketing revolves around social media campaigns, challenges, and advertising.

    <div className={styles.text52}>
      I came across Gramatiks fundraise via SingularDTV and started to truly deep dive into tokenization. At the time I didn’t move forward with fundraising because I believed there needed to be more utility outside of simply raising capital to find success. I love the idea of a bilateral relationship with my fanbase, most record deals are unilateral. One of my original startup ideas was to move fans/supporters from mass communication platforms like social media onto a more personal and intimate experience, social tokens and NFTs enable this so I naturally gravitated towards it.
      <br /><br />
      I launched on Rally which has a great onboarding process and helpful community.
      <br /><br />
      My social token powers my digital fan club w a focus on enabling my supporters rather than just extracting from them, they share in my success through earning rewards for completing bounties such as supporting my music on their social media, unlocking access to a gated discord server with roles where I share all my content exclusively before releasing it. I also manage a WhatsApp group since the majority of my fanbase is from LatAm. I do something similar to discord but it's for the super fans.
      <br /><br />
      Over time I want to transition my d2c strategy over to my social token allowing fans to buy exclusive merch drops and access to IRL experiences/ events for holders.

      There are so many! I have been active on Audius and Catalog over the last few months. I like what Daniel Allan, Latasha, and Harrison First are doing for web3 and their music is great. I follow quite a few people on Audius and actually have a playlist with latin artists.
