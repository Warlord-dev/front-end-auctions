        With so much volume cascading into the NFT space, it’s no wonder that there is high demand for better tools and interfaces for being able to effectively intake and make sense of all of that data— for, although it’s transparently all there on

        the blockchain for anyone to query, learning how to effectively use a block explorer and then extrapolate other metadata is no simple feat. Dedicated to building the infrastructure of the blockchain world and providing high-quality blockchain data support and services for developers and users. And this is exactly what NFTScan is solving for, developing a platform and API for easy NFT asset browsing and data analysis, for how else are we meant to stay ahead of all those HFT NFT traders? xD

        <span>IMPERSONATOR</span><br />
        Impersonator is an interesting project that has come to fruition, where it effectively allows anyone to “impersonate” a wallet address under a read only status. It’s motivation is for increasing ease of access to web3 and removing first mile technical barriers to entry, whereby many DAPPs today require login/”connect wallet” in order for a user to access and better understand what the product is all about. Impersonator let’s you get this “behind the scenes” access without having to go through the full process of setting up a wallet + there are also unique use cases like being able to check how whales are using dapps like Aave, Uniswap etc. and getting information on liquidity provisions, amount borrowed etc.

        <span>BanksEA Finance</span><br />
        The intersection between NFTs and DeFi continues to strengthen as new innovative use cases come to light and more of the web3 ecosystem experiments to better understand just how utility can be compounded when the two sectors are combined together.  Banksea Finance is one of these protocols mixing NFTs with DeFi through their NFT price discovery protocol and pool-based lending hub whereby price oracles consist of both an on-chain and off chain layer where AI nodes feed price prediction into the onchain layer. This off-chain layer is decentralised allowing for the Banksea Oracle Smart Contract to use the consensus algorithm to eliminate a bad node if one turns malicious.

        <span>Venrate</span><br />
        Our reputations dictate a lot. And, this can be a very positive feature (when it’s accurate), however, in the centralised web2 era whereby often your reputation score is not actually reflective of your actions and activity, but rather, at the whims of a centralised controller, it’s most often not (accurate). Venrate is a decentralised credit score and reputation system, whereby blockchain activity and data is used to assess the reputation of a user. It’s still not completely comprehensive in covering all relevant and important data points for ensuring our contributions at all scales are unambiguously evaluated, but, it is certainly a great first step in moving away from traditional means of reputation scoring, which are designed to benefit just a select few.

      <div className={styles.text13}>
        the team is developing code template frameworks and creating code generators that accept configurations from end-users.
        <br /><br />
        When implemented, this is a big game changer for bootstrapping web2 devs directly into the full immersion of web3. There are still far too few full time proficient web3 Solidity devs — and learning complex immutable code with automated executions that is optimised for gas fees and also the live market is no easy task. 
        <br /><br />
        Having more streamlined and supportive infrastructure to guide code best practises and also make readily available important features and functions is fundamental to quickly scaling this space in a robust manner. For, eventually, imagine being able to drag and drop code modules to safely deploy an entire web3 ecosytem; from NFT minting, DeFi lending, DeCo and more. 
        <br /><br />
        And frankly, this just supports the entire shift further into full metaversal immersion. Our interfaces are changing, and to think that lines of code in a IDE is how we will be creating and shaping the future of digital assets and more is well off the mark.

        WayFare
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text15}>
        Setting up a DAO or decentralised community is one thing, and in fact, to label yourself as a pseudo-DAO isn’t really that hard. We’ve all heard the popular lightning round steps on “how to set up a DAO”... and it usually goes somewhere along the lines of; post on Mirror to start a crowdfund and launch a token, set up a multisig, launch a discord and include token gated access etc. etc. 
        <br /><br />
        However, in reality, starting a long lasting, vibrant and on-course decentralised community that actually has the necessary aligned engagement to achieve what it has set out to accomplish, with enough purpose and value to not lose criticial momentum— well, that’s a completely different story, and, coming from someone who is breathing this in day and night, it’s also not that easy. It requires real commitment, time, effort and resource. The tools we use to create the DAO might be readily available, but often, the pre-cultivated tribes of eager participants are not. 
        <br /><br />
        However, with that said, one remarkable attribute of building in web3 is that network effects are so much more kinetic, spreading from edge to edge in rapid cycles. Thus, cultivating strengthened trust and relationships between community members reaps massive benefits.  And, when this is combined with intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, this connective fuel ignites. 
        <br /><br />
        Wayfare is a newly designed discord bot that builds both inter and intra DAO trust and affinity through mutual assistance and incentivised web3 contributor wayfinding. 
        <br /><br />
        It works right out of the discord servers that a lot of us call home, creating network effects at squad scale. The bot actively sources quests from DAOs and individual DAO members and connects these quests up with people that are well positioned to solve them.
        <br /><br />
        Community members and DAOs can submit !gives and !asks and alongside direct mutual assists between DAO members, DAOs can route contribution bounties through the bot to the members in the extended meta-community best positioned and most eager to go full time DAO.
        <br /><br />
        Rewards can be anything from native tokens, speciality NFTs, to the possibility of a full time gig within a truly web3 native world.
        <br /><br />
        You can think of Wayfare like a human in the loop AMM, where rather than incentivising a generic race to the bottom free for all where the reward is little and competition is high, instead, Wayfare responds what people actually want— high quality personalised human connection.
