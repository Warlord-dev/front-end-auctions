        Case in point, it’s in fashion to claim you’re in web3. But are you really grounded in its principles or is it really just a race to squeeze the most money out of the most marks possible? Are you really for decentralization or are you just selling the illusion and milking the proverbial cow one more time?
        <br /><br />
        See, the term “metaverse” has fast become a buzzword being co-opted by opportunistic corporates and brands looking to profit from its cachet in recent years (with a matching press release to boot), or by unscrupulous folks trying to make a quick buck shilling their latest NFTs to make some quick cash.
        <br /><br />
        The lack of this firm grounding on the principles of decentralization has led to a severe misunderstanding of the web3 technologies that serve as its infrastructure and the values they espouse.

        Anchoring our identities to the core principles of web3 gives us the technology’s greatest advantages, rather than the mere knowledge of how to build, mint, and take part in the ecosystems we frequent on web3.
        <br /><br />
        Anchored identities don’t ebb and flow with the times. Or the next grift.
