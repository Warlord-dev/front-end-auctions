        Centralization is anti-democratic at heart, and the evidence is out there in the open.
        <br /><br />
        Social networks were once fun and novel for friends and strangers to bond over commonalities and interests until their dispiriting, frustrating, and demoralizing descent into the degenerate circus that they have been reduced to now. 
        <br /><br />
        But many users begrudgingly accept the social media monkey on their backs, warts, scars, centralization, and all–especially given the fact that our primary means of socialization during the pandemic became the Facebook groups, Telegram chats, Discord servers, and TikTok stories on our computers and mobile devices.
        <br /><br />
        Web2 creates communities that don’t really feel like communities in the sense of the word because of its apparent pitfalls. Spend any amount of time on social media, and you’ll run into some form of toxicity one way or another. Unfortunately, there isn’t an alternative yet – and the reality is that only Big Tech has hitherto provided the only option for any sort of community in these trying times.

      <div className={styles.text2}>
        Case in point: Facebook and Twitter have mushroomed into monoliths that hold all the stroke over how we interact on the internet and how we consume our media. Social media is behind some of the most pressing questions about the value these technologies have brought–or Pandora’s box they have wrought–on society.
        <br /><br />
        Facebook has been a cesspool of political propaganda, gaslighting, and brainwashing, richly living off the content that its users create, regardless of their veracity. Twitter is rife with coordinated actions involving bots and fake accounts that run roughshod on individuals’ feeds (and collective sanity).
        <br /><br />
        We’ve gotten so used to putting up with the centralized bullshit that we tolerate the pitfalls of losing privacy, being exposed to malicious or coordinated online social behavior, and the constant censorship prevalent on each platform. But for lack of a better option, we’ve acclimated ourselves to finding communities on web2.
        <br /><br />
        It’s far from perfect. It’s far from “free.” But we can’t discount the fact that web2 apps are valuable tools for furthering the tenets of decentralization, web3, and the lifeblood of the latter: community.
