          1. How did you get into modding? Was there anything/one in particular that inspired you to
          start?
        </b>
        <br />
        I was on GitHub once and there was a Minecraft mods repo and I wanted to mod Minecraft and
        any other game that I own in my library, basically GitHub made me start my modding journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          2. What games do you usually mod and what type of modding do you like the best? More
          changing the game mechanics or instead the visuals/aesthetics/skins?
        </b>{' '}
        <br /> I usually mod Fortnite, I own a private server, I like people making mods that will
        help the players and it adds a lot to the game, so I would prefer more changing game
        mechanics.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          3. What are your thoughts on open source gaming? Do you think the future is more about
          open source in gaming and game content?
        </b>{' '}
        <br /> Open source is good. But there are Script Kiddies everywhere that can steal your work
        and reproduce it, so, I think that there needs to be better ways to make sure open-source
        works in the devs/creators favour, rather than allowing for cheats & hackers to ruin the
        game.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>
          4. More controversial question; what are your broader thoughts on the modding community in
          general?
        </b>{' '}
        <br /> Sometimes it can be a bit toxic, how do we make it more inclusive for newcomers so
        they stay motivated wth modding? They can share screenshots of their mod to get the
        community more hyped, but not much, so basically leak tiny things to get the community
        motivated with modding and maybe inspire them to make their mod!
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>5. Any cool/best/crazy stories you have from modding?</b> <br /> I think it's not that
        best, but a guy mailed me for a Fortnite private server idea that would make me join into
        Fortnite modding community, now that guy is my community manager.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>6. What's your fav game/s and why?</b> <br /> Fortnite, Minecraft, Stick Empires, Portal,
        Portal 2 and Garry's mod.
