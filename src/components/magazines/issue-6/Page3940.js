        I have a tiny bit of web dev experience (nothing professional) and experimented with python
        tutorials. I learned about a new language, Solidity, and heard from someone you could build
        permanent apps that don’t need to be running on your own server for anyone in the world to
        use at any time. This blew me away and I knew I had to learn more. I started with
        cryptozombies (which I still recommend any new people to Solidity and EThereum dev start
        with), and then just kept getting deeper and deeper slowly by building. The more I learned
        about crypto, the more obvious it has become that Ethereum is where new things really get
        built, and that is the most interesting part by far. The best way to learn is by doing.

        ELI5: There 1 giant pool of floor priced NFTs from various sets. Putting NFTs into the pool
        gives you varying amount of (erc20) FLOOR tokens that can be used anywhere in DeFi. Floor
        can be redeemed for any NFTs in the pool. The value of the NFTs in the pool is always at
        least 1:1 with FLOOR tokens value. NFTs have taught more people about crypto than any other
        type of product by several orders of magnitude. The dream is for NFT holders to learn about
        DeFi and all the cool financial tools that they have never had access to before. There are
        several protocols like NFT20 and NFTX that just scrape the surface of unlocking the value of
        NFTs for DeFi. However, each type of NFT gets its own pool, so the liquidity for each one is
        small & not enough to really do much with at the moment. Its obvious that there will be an
        AAVE like protocol a year from now when lending + yield on NFTs, there simply too much money
        on the table for there not to be. But we can’t build that without liquidity pools. I started
        DanceFloor (still a WIP) because I was tired of waiting for those other protocols to figure
        out how to increase usable liquidity dramatically. With DanceFloor’s “one big pool” design,
        instead of many smaller ones, I believe we can create a more effective pool to liquidate &
        efficiently trade bulk NFTs against, totally unlocking DeFi for them.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        If you’re buying floor priced assets, that is to say NFTs that are priced at the minimum
        price items in that set are going for, do you care which one you get? If you’re buying a
        bunch all at once at this minimum “Floor” price probably not. This is where the floor in
        Dance Floor comes from. #1 is bunchy protocol, I think they are most likely to become the
        “aave of NFTs”. But there are all kind of pawn shop, yield aggregating, options, and lending
        things you could build for NFTs if you have an effective deep liquidity pool to do
        liquidations against.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        I think its impossible to programatically decide whats a “good” type of NFT and not. That
        has to be decided by the community of users, who can judge for themselves. That where the
        DANCE token comes in. DANCE governs the protocol, and the community of holders decides what
        NFT types are allowed to be used in DanceFloor. At some point we will definitely rent out a
        night club in NYC and only DANCE holders in. On top of that… I’m not sure yet, theres a lot
        of ways the protocol could evolve from the early stage we are still at. I’m excited to see
        what other people come up with.
        <br />
        <br />
        The thing thats the most interesting to me is the permenance of it all. Humans have pretty
        much always clung to various kinds of collectables. But how many of those are simply lost to
        time? I think theres a serious chance many of the NFTs I own will exist longer than I will,
        and thats pretty cool to me.

        What got you interested in advocating more for community with a capital C?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        I've always loved building community. When I graduated college in 2009, my first job was a
        Community Manager at a startup. I couldn't believe I could get paid to build online
        communities.
        <br />
        <br />
        But I quickly realized two things:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It wasn't just something I loved… I genuinely believed that it would be the future of
            how businesses functioned. It was a massive opportunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's going to be a really hard road, because at that point businesses still didn't
            really understand the value of community, and since it was a new industry there weren't
            any guides, trainings, or networks where I could learn how to do this work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        So it became the focus of my career: build communities for businesses and help to develop
        and define the "community industry". I made it my mission to help other community
        professionals thrive.

        Are there any unique intrinsic and extrinsic rewards systems or structures that you have
        seen work well? Why?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text9}>
        Intrinsic rewards don't need systems. They're intrinsic. It's when someone contributes to
        the community because they genuinely care about the other members and feel a sense of
        commitment. It has to happen organically. And without it, extrinsic rewards won't be
        effective.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once your members have intrinsic motivation, then you can use extrinsic rewards to further
        validate them and their contributions.
        <br />
        <br />I like the SNAP framework, which was developed by Holly Firestone at Venafi. SNAP
        stands for:
        <br />
        <br />
        Status: think things like badges, karma, points, titles… anything that signifies status
        within a community Networking: inviting members to exclusive events and experiences together
        Access: giving members the ability to meet people or groups that they otherwise wouldn't
        have access to… like your CEO or a celebrity Perks: swag, discounts, benefits, gifts… people
        love their branded socks
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        Engagement and momentum within a community are two important key features. What are some of
        the best ways that people can go about better generating and incentivising stronger
        engagement and connectivity between members and communities?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        Consider diversifying group sizes. People tend to crave the group size they don't currently
        have.
        <br />
        <br />
        So if you have a very big group on a forum or discord, consider offering opportunities to
        connect in smaller groups. You could organize a dinner or discussion group. Or even offer
        1-1 introductions, which you can use tools like Donut or Orbiit.ai to facilitate
        automatically.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your community has been gathering in smaller groups, consider creating a larger space for
        them to gather, like a forum, Discord, or hosting a large conference.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can also mix up asynchronous and synchronous experiences. Live events are good for depth
        where members can actually meet each other and get to know each other better, especially
        in-person. Asynchronous spaces are better for breadth, where you can talk to a lot of people
        24/7.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, built rituals into your community. You could do a weekly "new member welcome" or a
        monthly meetup on the first Tuesday of every month. Perhaps every member who joins your
        community goes through the same initiation ritual. It creates repetition for your members,
        which helps them build habits of participation and a sense of shared experience.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text12}>
        You are moving more into exploring further around web3 communities. How do you think that
        greater emphasis on community building within web3 will unlock, reinforce and ultimately
        multiple adoption of this space?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        Web3 and community come hand-in-hand. DAOs are led by the community. NFT projects are
        successful only if they're able to curate an engaged community around it. The entire
        ecosystem is reliant on a vast network of contributors.
        <br />
        <br />I think what we'll quickly start to see is that having a lot of people in a Discord
        does not equate to a healthy, meaningful community. And after the initial rush of a drop,
        the long-term success of projects will be directly correlated with having a healthy
        community. It requires having a purpose, beyond just getting rich, and curating members who
        are genuinely interested in being a part of the mission, not just flipping.
        <br />
        <br />
        If Web3 is going to be adopted by the mainstream, it has a lot of work to do as an industry
        to become a more welcoming and inclusive community. It's still way too dominated by white
        males and I don't see enough projects making DEI a priority. There's also a huge learning
        curve preventing people from getting actively involved in the space. The more all of us
        working in Web3 can use community as a tool to prioritize diversity, and create a more
        newbie friendly ecosystem, the more everyone will win.

        What's the ideal model and key principles for authentically growing a community?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text15}>
        Some ideal principles for running communities:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Community first. If it's good for your business, but not good for your community, don't
            do it
          </li>
          <li>
            Build with, not for. Involve your members in the process of crafting the community. This
            was inspired by my friends who published the book Get Together
          </li>
          <li>
            Change reality. Communities are alternate universes where you get to design a new social
            structure and set of norms. Use unique "rules" and "rituals" to make your members feel
            like your community lets them live a different life…one they've always wanted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start small. Small is a super-power when it comes to communities because it gives you an
            opportunity to be very intentional with how you design the culture. And your first
            members will serve as the mold for your culture. All new members will just copy what
            they see when they enter the room.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be consistent. Keep showing up. Even if no one else is there. Even if no one responds.
            Your persistent contribution of your own time and energy will give others a reason to
            contribute their own time and energy. But it all starts with you.{' '}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text16}>
        What are the right metrics that anyone building and growing a community should be looking
        at?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text17}>
        There are three levels of community metrics to track:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Business level: how is community impacting revenue?
        <br />
        <br />
        Use The SPACES Model to determine your objectives and metrics.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Community level: is our community active, engaged, and healthy?
        <br />
        <br />
        For quantitative metric, track things like Monthly Active Users (MAUs), Daily Active Users
        (DAUs), Stickiness (DAU/MAU), and for live experiences and events, track repeat attendance
        rates.
        <br />
        <br />
        Make sure to also collect qualitative metrics by conducting surveys and interviews, to
        determine if members are having a valuable experience (we use NPS), and feel safe, welcome,
        and heard.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Tactical level: is our content and programming working?
        <br />
        <br />
        This gets into the day-to-day content and experiences you're creating for your community as
        you want to constantly be experimenting to see what results in creating an engaged
        community, that drives business results.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, you can measure the success of a community event by looking at attendance
        rates, survey responses, and event engagement.
        <br />
        <br />
        Or for an online community, you can measure the success of a ritual by measuring comment
        rates week-over-week for three months, then determine if you'll keep doing that ritual or
        not.
