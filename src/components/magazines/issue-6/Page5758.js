        I have been in crypto since 2012, but I never felt like crypto was a community. In fact, when I would go to let's say a place to buy Bitcoin it was always a very sketchy feeling like you might get hit over the head with a tire iron, and NFTs were the first time I realized that crypto was a community, a beautiful community. I'm not saying there wasn't one beforehand. It was just the first time I realized it, especially because my background was in art and my whole passion in life before and after was trying to help artists find their own voice. And I still do that today in the NFT space. And of course I do that with different communities.
        <br /><br />
        And so when I saw that the creative world was coming into crypto through NFTs, I thought this is my opportunity to make a life here. And so of course at the time there weren't many projects and there weren't many communities, but one of them that stood out immediately was Axie Infinity, it came very shortly after crypto kitties.
        <br /><br />
        They had amazing velocity in terms of being able to launch and being in that community felt so special because it was very unlike today in the sense that there was no money. There were only dreams. Everyone had a dream of what they wanted to do in the future. And what was empowering this dream was NFTs. The idea that you could be an owner of your digital life and of the things that were important to you digitally. And so after spending time in that community and understanding how important the community will be for the future, I realized the power of Axie Infinity, because man did that community have incredible dreams and were all of them committed, even when there was nothing in the NFT space, there was no volume. All of them were committed to Axie Infinity. And so coming from the art world background,  I've been able to develop this methodology for buying, for investing into art, which transfers over very well to unique digital assets and it's to always buy what you love. And when you have the opportunity to trust your gut and to always buy the best work you can, because as the market moves up in value, the best moves up the most. We'll always move up as an outlier further than the rest of the markets. It's an especially good opportunity when the market is very close together. When it hasn't had time to really spread out yet and for everything to define its value. And so at the time my business partner thought I was absolutely insane and my family and everyone around me when I spent around $10,000 on the quad mystic.
        <br /><br />
        But I knew that if it was actually as special as I thought, if this community really could build out their dreams, then it would be the outlier and one incredibly special NFT that defined or helped define the ecosystem. And so that's why I made that big bet on Gladiatorial. No one, I mean, I think there was one sale that was around that amount. It was the best decision I ever made and it allowed me to double down into the NFT space. I had major skin in the game. Now I was buying something that I believe might have value years and years away because no one was going to buy it off me at that time.
        <br /><br />
        It wasn't about that. It was just about having that special asset and it allowed me to start exploring more of the NFT space and get involved in more things. And that's the backstory. 
        <br /><br />
        <span>ON BAYC</span><br />
        BAYC is a membership club and it's made up of 30,000 different uniquecworks of art that represent whatever you want them to represent and they are tied to membership into the yacht club. There are the Board Apes specific at the top of this, they get the most member benefits. Then you have the mutants and then you have below them the dogs. And all of those together create 30,000 unique memberships, all with different access into BAYC and the future value that will be derived from the community.
        <br /><br />
        BAYC is this industry defining and shaping the way that we build companies in the future as an extension of NFTs as ownership. Just like I was talking about with Axie Infinity and the community, being able to dream and build these ideas, they were able to feel confident in dreaming and spending their time in the space when there was no immediate upside, because they felt like owners of the space, because an NFT gives you ownership and never before had that happened before. In the last 20 years we've been building our digital identities, but as most people know, we don't own a single part of those digital identities. Any web to social media company owns the ability to monetize our data. They own our handle. They've done an incredible job, even when ownership has not been issued, but for everyone else there's been something missing. And that ownership is that essential part. Now what BAYC did to change the game, embedding IP rights within that ownership. So not only do you own what you have, you actually have the right to build a business on top of it.
        <br /><br />
        And so instead of BAYC dictating, because that's how we want our brand to go, this is how we want our members to act. They said, hey, we're actually just going to bring this group together. We're going to try our best to add new value and to remain cool. But what you do with yours, your dog, your mutant is in your hands. And so by giving the members of BAYC the ability to own their own NFTs and to build businesses on top, all of a sudden they increased the value dramatically because no one had ever given people within a company, to put it a different way. No one had ever treated consumers like participants with what they're consuming. BAYC members started to build their own businesses and that level of agency, all of a sudden spread to the whole rest of the industry, it's now become normal to include IP rights. 
        <br /><br />
        It's incredible. And what happens is as the value accrues to each of these individuals, the value of accrues to BAYC and subordinate clubs becomes more valuable and then buying into a BAYC becomes more valuable because you have all that intrinsic value that was created by all the members and by BAYC itself.
        <br /><br />
        So it's really a paradigm shift in how companies are being built and it all falls to the community because the community are the ones that take the IP and make it into something valuable that the company can't do to it. And so understanding that the community can unlock a 100x, a 1000x more value when you include them in the process is a production shift.
        <br /><br />
        <br />
        <span>ON RARITY</span><br />
        Any value, and if it does, it's very short-lived without having a very strong narrative to back that rarity up. And so BAYC has been able to create an incredible narrative and then the rarity is overlaid on top of that. And so that's why the derivatives have been so successful, the ones that BAYC produced because they're wrapped up into the same narrative with the OG apes. I think that community is not scalable for the community members to feel appreciated and to be able to produce value. These numbers need to remain pretty safe. So, I don't think board BAYC is going to grow to a million members. I think there will be a million BAYCs and they will all have different niches that they are set up around. And they will all have slightly different directions and all have slightly different founding teams with different ways to treat their community members. And as someone entering into space, you're going to have so many options. Where do I want to contribute? What do I want to represent my idea? 
        <br /><br />
        I think that there will be a membership club for every single strata in terms of pricing. And there are even clubs that have inclusivity built into their membership. So for instance, Cool Cats is all about being inclusive.
        <br /><br />
        And they're going to be offering, I think, an unlimited amount of what they're calling paper cats for some very, very small amount of money where anyone can own a derivative paper cat and be a part of the Cool Cats club. And so something like that makes it accessible for everybody, but I don't suggest that every PFP project takes that model.
        <br /><br />
        You want to know who your community is and some communities will be completely inclusive. And there won't be a price barrier. Some will be highly exclusive based on price. Some will be highly exclusive based on something else. You don't have to buy in with it. When you have on-chain data, there's so many other things you can buy into that we're just starting to explore.
        <br /><br />
        Maybe you're someone who has traded DeFi for five years. Well, you get a PFP just because you traded DeFi for five years and you're in a small club, you know, there's so many ways to go about it. But yeah, I mean, I think that the market's going to be so large that anyone can start any PFP at any price range.
        <br /><br />
        If price is prohibitive for you, I'd probably start on an L2 like polygon and that allows you to start collecting, and it's very affordable and that allows you to start buying into the space. And if it’s about creating some history, I would actually start off chain, but start creating your community around you. And that's something on Twitter or a Clubhouse or Telegram or Discord, or any of these platforms that all of us use and share your opinion or ask a question or reach out to someone that you admire for a conversation.
        <br /><br />
        All of these things bring you deeper into the community. It doesn't necessarily need to be on chain for you to start feeling like you're a part of the community and the more educated you get, the more you can risk your capital investing in NFTs and starting to create that on chain history.
