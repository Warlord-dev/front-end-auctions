        I've been creating 3D models since 2015. I enrolled in a university here in the Philippines
        as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology majoring in Animation and Game
        Development. I always envision myself to be part of something big and I thought making games
        was really a thing that I might enjoy since I was dreaming to make one ever since I was a
        kid but I just didn’t know how back then. Creating art has always been my passion and seeing
        it inside a game where everyone enjoys gives me a different kind of excitement. I myself
        don’t like my art but seeing others appreciate what I do just fills me up with joy.

        <b>Favourite 3D software?</b>
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        I love Blender because it's open source and you can do beyond so many things! My favorite
        software for Sculpting 3D is Zbrush since it offers a variety of tools and I think it’s
        simply the best software for creating organic creatures. For hard surface modelling or any
        game props, I use Maya since it’s what I was taught in college and I was very used to the
        interface after using it for a long time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Last but definitely not the least, for anything voxel art, nothing beats VoxEdit. In my
        opinion it’s simply one of the best, especially when combined with the features and tools of
        magica voxel I believe you can break boundaries which inspires me to produce this artwork.
        <br />
        <br />
        The actual asset is also animated using VoxEdit and this software keeps getting better at
        every update.

        At first, NFT was a vague concept to me but I was already amazed by crypto currency in
        general so I ended up investing some of my savings into crypto after doing some research.

        Looking for a job opportunity here after graduating from college is quite challenging
        because every company is looking for someone who has experience already in a certain field.
        Having said that, it was pre-pandemic when I was hired at a startup gaming company which I
        absolutely loved and I really enjoy doing. For all I thought my dream was finally moving
        forward then, the Covid 19 came along and the company didn’t have enough power to sustain us
        which led us to be laid off. Looking for another job after that was a tough journey, so I
        decided to try 3D printing but that didn’t go so well either.
        <br />
        <br />I was thinking of other ways to earn money online, and was looking for investment
        opportunities until I saw Sandbox. Fortunately, they had an opening post as a freelance
        Creator Fund Artist so I tried my luck applying. To my surprise, I passed the exam and have
        been doing voxel art since then. The atmosphere that they brought made me motivated until I
        got an offer for a full-time job. The team is simply amazing and talented but what made me
        stick to Sandbox is how they care about their artists.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        On Sandbox we do a variety of assets with certain themes which are often exciting such as
        mechas, halloween, and Christmas. You can take a look at them{' '}

        . For wearables, I was able to make a legendary tier asset inspired from Chinese mythology.

        Why Sandbox? Just like what I’ve mentioned, it makes me want to stay and be loyal to them
        because of how they treat us artists. They never forget to give us the right compensation
        and the opportunities that they opened for us that would never be available if it weren’t
        for them. Our first NFT sale was a major success all thanks to their support.
        <br />
        <br />I believe that the pandemic made us realize there is also life in the metaverse. The
        concept of P2E brought food to the table for people like me who were laid off because of the
        Covid 19 virus. These games made us enjoy life and support our families at the same time
        although it’s not yet stable since it’s still a new concept to us, I believe in the future
        that it holds for everyone. Decentralization made us realize how free we can be with our
        finances that benefits everyone. I think we are still early in these stages but it has been
        looking very good from this point. I think the metaverse will soon be our new reality as
        time goes by and it can be both good and bad. It’s bad if we forget how to live in the real
        world but it’s great if we can benefit from it so we can live our life in the real world.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        The biggest challenge for me as an artist and I think I speak for a lot of artists out
        there, is that we don’t get valued as much in the real world. A lot of creative and artistic
        minds don’t get paid as much as they deserve because they feel so low about themselves that
        they are willing to accept any value people think they’re worth but with NFT’s, it makes
        people like us special. It shows us our worth as an artist and it brought everyone
        confidence in their art. Even memes are welcome and I think the community has been really
        generous about NFTs and I hope it could continue on and fix every artist’s sense of self
        worth. For Web3 I think it mostly values you as a person where you aren’t seen as a product
        anymore and which gives you more privacy and control over your own assets.
        <br />
        <br />
        To all the artists out there, I know how it can be scary to try a new path for our creative
        journey and sometimes we only want to try the things that other people already did however I
        think the universe has a way of creating new paths for us that may result to either good or
        bad but if we keep going through the same path over and over again, how do we experience
        change and growth? If people are not seeing value in your works it means that your place
        belongs somewhere else where you could fit in and who knows, it could be the metaverse.
        Alongside this, I would always recommend doing your own research before jumping on anything.

        Lots of creative stuff coming for the next few months. Of course, the most exciting part is
        still being part of The Sandbox, we saw how other games grew so big and The Sandbox already
        built a community that opened up doors for other communities as well. I’ve also been working
        on 2 NFT collections at the side, which is VoxaMech and PixaSouls. VoxaMech is a voxel art
        animated mecha card that I'm planning to release on Opensea but there will also be an
        animated game asset available soon in the TSB marketplace so watch out for that. Pixelsouls
        is a passion project that’s also an NFT collection that has 7777 unique souls that will soon
        be available on Opensea as well. If we’re lucky to have a successful launch, we also plan to
        create our own metaverse on Sandbox and we will be making Pixelsouls a playable NFT game.
