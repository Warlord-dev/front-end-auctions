        Web3 social clubs are increasingly adopting quests to onboard individuals who’ve always wanted to break into the space. For instance, we can look towards web3 social clubs such as RabbitHole, which developed a portal for individuals to learn about crypto and earn it by using the most frequently relied-on apps in web3. Quests include learning to use protocols and dapps such as Aave, Uniswap, Ethereum Name Service, or by learning everything about NFTs to start doing so by simply connecting their web3 wallets to their service. New users also have the opportunity to onboard themselves, participate via their Discord server, and get involved in the discussion.
        <br /><br />
        Ultimately, gamification supercharges communities and infuses them with the lifeblood needed to use and build web3 through an open approach to solving problems and sharing value. Leaderboards, badges, and quests allow organizations to align rewards with activities the users perform and desire. It’s also the potential unlock to financially rewarding the entire network for their engagement and intrinsic motivation for its participants to succeed.

        In the end, the history of religion is a testament to how gamification has always driven us to achieve extraordinary things. Plenty of belief systems are prefaced on fulfilling quests. Quests to make chaste, to make divine, ordeals, and travails to go through, to attain a higher state of being. Call it nirvana, salvation, reincarnation, redemption, practically any belief system’s end goal, for that matter, and the ultimate end is to achieve a prize. Religion is inherently incentivized to those who believe, and quests, as they do in web3 today, have always taken root deep into the human condition.
