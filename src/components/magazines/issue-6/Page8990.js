        Even the leadership dynamic changes within the context of web3 community structure. While we’re all too familiar with the almost cartoonishly cold and sociopathic Zuccs and Bezoses of the web2 realm, web3 founders need to be empathic to be able to collaborate, build trust within the community and engage, inspire, get down in the trenches, and achieve greater missions and visions together.
        <br /><br />
        NFTs are poised to be a supremely fundamental platform of how community is defined in the web3 ecosystem because of their significant role in organization, mobilization, and community building. By nature, we all desire to become part of and thrive in ecosystems that give us more value than we can contribute–but everybody has to be on board with the community’s vision for that to happen.

        Sure, to the unwashed, Crypto Twitter might appear to be a toxic cesspool. There’s a lot of people with a lot to say, with a variety of passionate opinions from a diverse selection of identities belonging to some tribal confederation of some sort defined by the PFPs they use. There is a lot of vitriol, venom, and criticism at times, but that’s just a built-in feature of the space. It’s part of being part of the community: web3 empowers individuals to find their voices and identities, their tribes, so they can interact and engage. And that passion for wanting to help make things better is what drives the entire space in the first place. 
        <br /><br />
        The mere fact that everyone is free to share their own worldview about how things can be better can only be a good thing. The more individuals are encouraged to do just that, the more freedom and opportunity the community and its members gain to see their efforts come to fruition. Ultimately, no one has all the answers, and no one knows whose vision is the right one. It’s an opportunity to rethink, reframe, and recreate the world and make it better than it was.
