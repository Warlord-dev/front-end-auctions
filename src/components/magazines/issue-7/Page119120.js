        Community is where we need to begin if there is to be any continued evolution and progress
        in web3. Communities are built on one defining and common denominator: individuals.
        Communities tend to unify individuals who are greater than their sum. A modicum of
        centralization is required in every community to build one, regardless of the vision and
        purpose thereof, and that’s where web2 apps like Discord, Telegram, or Twitter come into
        play. It’s just the rule with startups of any kind.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is yet value for all the limitations and pitfalls web2 apps possess, even when it is
        entirely apparent that there will be a time to “sunset” them all together. And it’s in their
        ability to harness the power of individuals working towards a shared vision and goal.
        <br />
        <br />
        We’ve seen how apps like Discord have become indispensable tools for building crypto and
        web3 communities, particularly for the token-gated communities that have sprouted forth in
        the wake of the ascent of NFTs, which have gotten individuals into the web3 rabbit hole in
        massive droves. Practically every project, community, DAO, or crypto-native creator has a
        server of some sort. The center of crypto discussion, on the other hand, is right in the
        thick of Twitter.

        The most cutting-edge conversations are happening in a Twitter Space somewhere, 24/7/365, no
        matter where you are. Ultimately, we can harness web2 apps as growth levers in our efforts
        to build towards a more open and decentralized future in web3–building at the speed of
        sound–until such time NFTs become the new paradigm of social media.
        <br />
        <br />
        Discord has, for instance, superseded Facebook Groups as far as being the primary platform
        for building community for the next generation. Ditto for Telegram Groups. We can’t deny the
        key role social media plays in fostering community–but we should all the more be wary of its
        totalitarian, anti-democratic tendencies. But they can be used as tools at the top of the
        funnel that lead into the token-gated communities we are increasingly starting to live in.
        <br />
        <br />
        There’s no doubt that the future of social media could lie in decentralization. It’s already
        happening. NFTs are unlocking community and delivering unique, shared experiences with
        individuals who share the same passion (or PFP)–and it’s just a matter of time until the
        next great web3 social platform fixes the broken model of web2 social media.
