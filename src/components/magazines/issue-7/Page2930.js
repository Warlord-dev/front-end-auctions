        Chronicle, an NFT marketplace that launched this year, 2021, is taking its next steps, alongside NEAR Protocol, to reduce their net carbon emissions to effectively zero. The marketplace itself is targeted at providing a dedicated experience for fans of some of the current leading sports teams, entertainers, and other familiar brands and studios. Chronicle will be using NEAR as the main blockchain infrastructure to power the project, especially whilst other environmentally conscious and Proof of Stake chains are still transitioning to being ready for live market usage. 
        <br /><br />
        In line with the NEAR protocol partnership, Chronicle will also be partnering with the global nonprofit, Pandas International, for devoting resources to ensure the preservation of the habitat and population of the endangered Giant Panda.  And, this is being achieved not through a traditional web2 alturistic model, which often are so opaque and indirect, but

        With only 1864 Pandas left in the wild  <br />
        this couldn’t come at a better time, as well as highlight the real power of NFTs in all of their glory. This unique and transparent unit of record and conveyance means that capital, time and resource can be openly and almost instantly

        Manhattan Solar Partners recently announced their plans to construct the biggest renewable-powered cryptocurrency mining data center in the USA, whereby the new centers will utilize more than a gigawatt of renewable energy in Texas. To give some greater perspective, a single gigawatt is enough to power north of either 10 million light bulbs, 3.125 Million Photovoltaic (PV) Panels, 1.3 million horses, or 9,090 Nissan Leafs. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        Either way, you get the gist, it’s a whole lot of energy. 
        <br /><br />
        Texas is beginning to become a mecca for Bitcoin, and other crypto, mining operations, particularly after the most recent China ban, which has forced many groups out of the 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        region. The low cost of energy and greater access to renewable sources, like that of solar and wind, which make up 25% of the state’s total energy generation, is continuing to place it as an appealing destination for transforming the crypto mining space into a force for good, with 16 gigawatts of new wind and solar projects planned for construction in West Texas over just the next year.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        Further, this new mining market is also set to provide Texas with much needed additional power for extreme events, helping to prevent catastrophes like what we saw earlier this year. Bitcoin miners are acting as a shock absorber, buying up excess energy when it’s not needed, then shutting down their mining rigs when demand surges, releasing power back onto the grid.

        ImpactNFT uses NFTs to wayfare capital towards public goods and projects working on positive societal impact and change. The alliance is hosting Hong Kong’s very first NFT exhibition this month, whereby a range of NFT artworks will be on display for sale that were designed specifically for charity organisations and global impact projects dedicated to achieving the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        The works are visually provoking, featuring some of the detrimental human impacts that have effected the environment and also projects that are merging technology and sustainability to pave the way for achieving a greater global environmental conscious.
        <br /><br />
        It’s expected that many more of these hybrid IRL-digital NFT gallery events will continue to occur at more frequent instances, especially as pandemic restrictions loosen up over the coming months— and for that, the range of previously disregarded minority issues that actually have super majority support but are put aside because it would undermine and threaten the incumbency of those currently in control, suddenly now have a high fidelity set of methods to source capital through crowdfunding, direct NFT sales, multiple editions etc.
