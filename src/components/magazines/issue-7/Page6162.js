      <div className={styles.text2}>E-SPORTS RISING STAR OF THE MONTH</div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        At just 15 years old, Dreaz is considered one of the fastest rising Rocket League players, having only started with competing at a professional scale end of 2019. He joined team Guppies mid 2020 until its disbandment the same year in September. Since then he’s gone on to join G2 Esports as an active player, with the team placing 7th place in the RLCS 2021-22 - Fall: North America Regional Event 1. He’s still got a lot to prove and more work to put in, however, being in the industry so young, it’s exciting to see how his career pans out as blockchain, esports and gaming merge.

        Shanghai Dragon’s player Jae-Won Lip was named the 2021 Overwatch League Grand Finals MVP. He is a South Korean player, and one of the most outspoken on the team, having had to even make public apology statements previously for uttering inappropriate slurs against rival teams. And, it is this passion that has also kept him a student of his game, as he continues to improve and acquire more impressive win streaks.

      <div className={styles.text9}>TSM FTX partners with solana and aurory</div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        The TSM FTX esports team recently released their first official NFT collection on Solana as exclusive NFT avatars combined with the team’s official merch. This partnership between TSM and FTX is an interesting mix, with FTX paying over $200 million for the co-naming rights in a very web2 deal. Esports x crypto is certainly a space worth paying close attention to, especially as P2E becomes more and more the gaming norm. However, it also poses the question— is P2E not just decentralised esports and if so, why do we need the old traditional camp programs and industry agencies that take all of the profits from the players and set up the deal to be extractive. Removing barriers and central controllers so that finally anyone can earn income and a livelihood from engaging in and adding value to a digital economy changes the enitre gaming landscape. These middleman are no longer needed.

      <div className={styles.text12}>
        And so, although this TSM FTX NFT drop propels the broader esports and gaming industries towards becoming more web3 accustomed, 
        it also emphasises the need for us to take the bottom up approach from the start. 
        For, if not, then ultimately all we are engaging in is one-sided NFT drops & big branded partnerships that perpetuate the legacy players 
        for leveraging off their “web2.5” status. 
        Truly embracing a decentralised esports model empowers both players and creators, and that game, is one anyone would prefer to play, stream or watch.

      <div className={styles.text14}>
        As the whole world continues to go NFT, so does EVOS Esports, in a collaborative effort with Sora’s Dreamworld. 10,000 avatars will be minted on Ethereum, with a special 5 custom PFPs set aside for the EVOS team and coach— which they will rep in upcoming tournaments. It won’t be long before we see these avatars make their way across games, fully representing the players during their competitive battles and major highlight moments.
