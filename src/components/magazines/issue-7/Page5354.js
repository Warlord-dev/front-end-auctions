        It's almost standard nowadays for every DeFi
        <br />
        protocol to be governed by a DAO or include some
        <br />
        sort of decentralised community token voting influence. Do you think that these community
        mechanics in deciding on key proposals slows down the ability for a core team to keep up
        with the rest of the market, or, can it actually accelerate them and point their focus to
        key market opportunities?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        It's definitely a bit of both! The process of ideation (Discord + forum posts), focused
        discussion (RFC), proposal (PIP) and DAO vote can definitely add time to the process - but
        at the same time, the value of many voices and opinions cannot be under-estimated. Bigger
        decisions about the protocol that the DAO usually focus on are worthy of debate, and so the
        process we have in place currently is a good
        <br />
        balance of robust disucssion and decision making, while still being nimble and taking
        advantage of the opportunities that arise in this fast moving
        <br />
        environment.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        How has the experience been
        <br />
        in particular for Dill DAO so far in navigating
        <br />
        decentralised community coordination? What are the ups
        <br />
        and downs and how do you effectively incentivise core contributors?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        So far the DILLDAO experience has been extremely positive. The
        <br />
        beauty and challenge of a diverse set of contributors is that they don't always agree, and
        that's a good thing as long as the conclusion is one that benefits Pickle Finance overall.
        The community that has formed around the DAO is extremely strong and active! The ups have
        included the new monthly community calls, the DILLDAO recently empowering a select group of
        the community to manage budget decisions such as hiring and marketing and generally the
        depth of knowledge and expertise that the
        <br />
        community provides. The downs can include times when the
        <br /> DAO cannot agree on a course of action (can lead to
        <br />
        prolonged discussion), or when a vote goes
        <br />
        against 'popular' opinion due to weight of
        <br /> votes held.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        As of now, $DILL is
        <br />
        the governance token for the protocol and
        <br />
        is earnt by locking up $PICKLE. Do you think that the
        <br />
        protocol will continue to keep the same token governance mechanics, or is there other models
        that you are considering to experiment with? Why this model?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        DILL is based on the model pioneered by Curve Finance and their veCRV approach to governance.
        The process of locking a token for a significant period of time (up to 4 years!) means that
        the DAO tends to have the long term interests of the protocol at heart, not just short term
        focus that can come from the approach of just holding a token in your wallet - as is the
        case with many other DEFI projects. Since Pickle implemented DILL, the same approach has
        gained populatory across many other projects. That said, we are always looking for ways to
        improve further. One aspect that leads to some debate currently is the fact that larger DILL
        holders can have significantly more say in governance than smaller holders. In one respect,
        this is justified because they have a greater monetary investment in the protocol (ie more
        Pickles locked for DILL). However in the context of a DAO, it means that the opinion of a
        few (people) can outweigh the wishes of the many. Before DILL,
        <br />
        Pickle Finance had pioneered the approach of quadratic voting - something
        <br /> that gained the attention of Vitalik Buterin, who himself is a
        <br />
        fan of the theory behind such an approach. Unfortunately, DEFI is such that it is easy to
        hold multiple wallets and so the approach was and is
        <br />
        open to manipulation - a sybil attack. With the advent of DILL, the community has recently
        been discussing the idea of revisiting
        <br />a quadratic voting approach - at this point the
        <br />
        discussion is still nascent.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        Dill DAO has a
        <br />
        unique structure with the SCCOC
        <br />
        appointed members having agency to further lead proposals
        <br />
        for the protocol and take on more responsibility within the community. What inspired this
        model and do you think that a tier structure in a DAO is vital for effectively delineating
        between and incentivising levels of engagement?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text9}>
        The SCCOC is a relatively new development, a group of people that has been given the power
        and responsibility of managing Pickle's budget. The idea for the committee stemmed from
        previous groups formed for the pupose of making some key hiring decisions, a model that
        worked well and so the scope was expanded and enhanced to include more responsibilties. So
        far, the SCCOC retains the trust of the Team and community and is making great progress on
        several fronts! The approach of tiers within a DAO works because it helps to focus the
        discussion within a smaller group. A DAO by its very nature can be large and diverse, but
        that can at times make decision making difficult. An appointed committee such as the SCCOC
        <br />
        becomes the voice of the DAO and its focus helps to
        <br />
        ensure that timely decisions are made which provide long
        <br />
        term benefit for the protocol.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        How transparent do you think a
        <br />
        DAO's token holder activities should be? I know it's something that Pickle has deliberated
        on in the past i.e. should the Dill discord channel be open or token gated. How do you think
        decentralised token communities should navigate this?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        After some debate, we have decided to make the DILLDAO channel in Pickle's Discord server
        open for all to see - however only DILLDAO members will retain write access (a right we feel
        they have by nature of their DAO membership). There will remain some information that is
        held from the public eye, because it is either sensitive/competitive information, or because
        it provides added benefit for those in
        <br />
        the DILLDAO - for example, early access to new Jars or Chains.
        <br />
        But as a whole, Pickle Finance is open and
        <br />
        collaborative and encouages the community
        <br />
        to be the same way!

        What's the dill
        <br />
        with Dill DAO...As an honorary member myself, 😄 why should people
        be lining up to get in to the Pickle shop?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        The DILLDAO is a strong community that is working together to drive growth and success for
        Pickle Finance. Practically, holding DILL entitles you to a 45% share of Pickle's revenues and
        so the success of the protocol automatically benefits the DAO - perhaps one of the reasons
        why the community is so strong and works together to help make Pickle successful. Also, it's
        a lot of fun! Great balance of in-depth discussion and <br /> memes among a friendly and
        welcoming <br /> community of like-minded Picklers. <br /> Some might say that it's a Big
        Dill :)

        Sifting through the web2 weeds— spotlighting stories from the walled gardens where they love
        to tangle and lurk.

      <div className={styles.text16}>EPIC GAMES.</div>
      <div className={styles.text17}>
        Well, to some, this edition of Gatekeeper Gardens featuring Epic Games might come as a bit
        of a shock, because a lot of us associate Tim Sweeney with the metaverse. And, the metaverse
        is meant to be open, founded on decentralised principles, and for that matter, definitely
        include NFTs. You’ve read the newspapers, seen the “epic” battle with Apple and the Judge’s
        ultimate decision that Tim Sweeney’s “personal beliefs about the future of the metaverse are
        sincerely held”— but how sincere can beliefs really be for a metaverse that isn’t completely
        and totaly embodying decentralisation across every aspect of it. The “open metaverse” isn’t
        just a buzzword, it isn’t just a technical nuance referring to implementation of advanced 3D
        interoperability, and it certainly isn’t a place where extractive web2 mechanisms and
        arrangements provide any value, besides to the same old small few, even if their PFPs or
        digital representations might allow them to seem more familiar and aligned.
        <br />
        <br />
        And, unfortunately, Sweeney’s views of the metaverse aren’t all that open. Instead, they
        support a tightly scoped region whereby Epic can maintain centralised control over how far
        reaching that digital conent is and the potential for perpetuous derivative, modded and
        expansive secondary market wealth generation.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text18}>
        It’s a shame really, as actually, instead of taking a defensive approach, Epic is well
        positioned, at least for now, to fully embrace NFTs, reward the players and creators who
        have made their digital economy, and, also leverage the influence and sway they have in the
        traditional gaming market to accelerate the pace at which web3, NFTs and decentralisation is
        normalised and adopted by all. To them, embracing “openness” might seem counter intuitive to
        their business model, however, if done right, web3 far outpaces any gains possible under
        web2’s jurisdiction, for catalytic squad wealth has commnunity and network effect impacts
        ten thousand X in magnitude than any one-sided user-as-product approach.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text19}>
        As much as we appreciate him going up against Apple and providing an alternative to
        Facebook, in all seriousness, wake me up when they go up against the CCP — the epitome of
        how devastatingly horrendous and catastrophic centralised governance really is and can be.
        And, with Tencent owning 40% of Epic Games, frankly, any metaverse coming out of Epic cannot
        be open, for this goes against everything that the CCP stands for, puts up with and
        sanctions as even remotely possible. So, what does it mean for us pioneering web3? We need
        to stop turning to legacy players as any sort of market validation that we are on the right
        track or reaching mainstream inflection points. Instead, being authentic and building to
        leverage the features of decentralisation is a far more sustainable and convex arbitrage
        than what we could imagine.
