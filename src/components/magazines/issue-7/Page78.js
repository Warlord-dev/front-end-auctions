        The impulse to care about living space–or territoriality, as it were–is programmed deep into practically every vertebrate walking this mortal plane. 
        <br /><br />
        One need only look at the perpetual state of war in the most contested pieces of land on earth. They have been theaters of hate and depravity, but altogether a seemingly evolutionary impulse hardwired to fight for land.
        <br /><br />
        Land was and still remains valuable because of its productive value. It stores monetary value, generates economic activity; physical land also derives its value from its inherent scarcity.
        <br /><br />
        Virtual realms have become attractive to the younger generation due to circumstances that have rendered it impossible for them to own real estate.

        It has created virtual worlds like Decentraland and Somnium Space that allow them to buy and sell virtual land plots and in-game products and services as a “not-to-miss” investment opportunity. Hmm. That’s a strange-looking metaverse. 
        <br /><br />
        The pitches we hear nowadays almost seem as if someone was trying to sell timeshares in Tijuana. And if I hear another virtual real estate pitch centered on muh scarcity, I swear I’m gonna throw up in my mouth.
        <br /><br />
        Nevertheless, this has given rise to a whole bevy of so-called “metaverse” real estate companies.
