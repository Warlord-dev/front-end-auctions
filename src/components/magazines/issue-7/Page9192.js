        Web3 communities have the proverbial skin in the game for them to have an incentive to
        achieve broader goals as a group. They are platformless and censorship-resistant, as opposed
        to the passively consuming communities of web2 whose sole existence is to consume content
        and have their data extracted for massive value–rather than sharing in the community’s
        upside.
        <br />
        <br />
        And without that community, every facet of value–from finances, culture, to content–can not
        be captured, created, or scaled.
        <br />
        <br />
        We all want to be part of something greater than ourselves. That’s why we crave community,
        identity, for our place in the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Think about how the largest communities draw their strength from the intensity of their
        individuals’ passion and belief. Take religion, for instance: religion captures the biggest
        delta of all because it costs virtually nothing to manufacture faith in a supreme being or
        an afterlife, regardless of the belief system in question. Then, think of how many people
        are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice–to die for their faith.
        <br />
        <br />
        In many ways, it takes that same fervor and zeal in incentivizing the community members to
        act in its best interest and govern and derive consensus if it is to move forward and
        achieve its objectives. Tokenomics, value creation, capturing the value between the cost of
        what it takes for the community to manufacture to provide the members and the community
        value in return all of these are features of web3 communities. Arguably, much of the value
        that’s going to be generated is in intangible items that don’t cost the greater community
        anything at all.
