        No matter how long we’ve been in crypto, many still struggle to grasp what is entirely going on with the furious pace the industry moves. All we know is something is happening, and things are moving. Fast. 
        <br /><br />
        But that’s just part and parcel of being in a space where a day is literally 1,000 years.
        <br /><br />
        Diving into web3 is diving into a perpetual learning process. That’s what makes it so enticing and challenging–and ultimately rewarding.
        <br /><br />
        Everyone who already has skin in this game shares the same dream of becoming a web3 full-timer.
        <br /><br />
        But where does one even start to begin? How do we find our way to the tribes we belong to within the vast expanses of the metaverse considering its diffuse, decentralized, and sometimes nebulous structures–and contribute to efforts to build, strengthen, and engage for the DAO?
        <br /><br />
        The answer is in the community. Community is everything in web3. 
        <br /><br />
        Because, the fact of the matter is, you can’t go it alone.
        <br /><br />
        The concept of being part of a community has never been as crucial as it is in crypto and web3–especially given its constant noise and the industry’s furious, breakneck pace.
        <br /><br />
        Mankind is a social species, and we have evolved to be tribal by design. The need for belonging, empathy, compassion, communication, and organization is what has led to our species’ triumph throughout the annals of history. It’s in our DNA to want to be part of and be something greater than ourselves.         
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        We need the right individuals to support us, encourage us, look out for us, and push us towards progress to find our way through the morass.
        <br /><br />
        We need to be part of a community where our voice matters—a place where we’re not only recognized but received with open arms. A community where our passion, presence, and participation are cherished and valued. A place where the value we create is closely entwined with the lives of real people–regardless of gender, race, creed, politics, sexuality, and everything else that divides us IRL. A community where we know 100% for sure we’re among kindred spirits.
        <br /><br />
        DAOs and decentralized web3 communities are the next logical evolution of how humans organize and coordinate resources. They serve as the neighborhoods our virtual selves “live” in. 
        <br /><br />
        But joining a web3 community isn’t as simple as just buying an NFT, joining a Discord server, and then sitting with your fingers up your ass expecting the world to cater to you. It doesn’t work like that. 
        <br /><br />
        Yes, they are permissionless. Yes, they are decentralized. But the lifeblood of web3 community is action.
        <br /><br />
        It’s about engaging and incentivizing its members to build up the community proactively. And in doing so, improve the network, improve themselves, and lift the efforts of the entire organization in line with its aims.
        <br /><br />
        It’s an entirely different paradigm from the legacy web community’s passive consumption.
        <br /><br />
        Web3 communities may be smaller as far as size is concerned compared to those whose businesses are supported by advertising–but the difference is when the community is committed to creating content, cooperating, and collaborating on projects beneficial to the group.
        <br /><br />
        And contrary to what you might think, there IS a community for you out there. There are a plethora of interests out there with a community with your name on it–whatever your passion might be.
