        The spirit of building for the bazaar is what makes web3 so unique. It is an aggregation of individuals acting autonomously to work over a shared vision, as the feedback loop that constantly stimulates the ecosystem generates value for each participant. It’s also what makes it so daunting.
        <br /><br />
        The signal-to-noise ratio increases as more protocols are created, increasing the curve for users who wish to experience using decentralized applications. On the other hand, networks have been trying to progressively decentralize to turn spectators and onlookers into users of an ecosystem. 
        <br /><br />
        Fortunately, the natively gamified nature of web3–expanding into more ways to gamify communities, projects, and incentives than you can shake a stick at–has made it easier than ever to onboard the increasing numbers of individuals determined to carve their way “on-chain.”
        <br /><br />
        From quests, leaderboards, teams, clans, hackathons, scavenger hunts, token drops, badges for participation in events, capital raising, social media, party voting, all sorts of strategies can be employed to further onboard, stimulate and incentivize members to contribute to the protocol’s growth.
        <br /><br />
        Gamification is taking over entire facets of our lives as we march bravely into 2525. There’s so much to discover and learn by just participating in web3 life–decentralized communities, DeFi, metaverse, NFTs, and modding–such that it almost feels like a renaissance is just around the bend.

        Quests, in particular, are an excellent way to drive contributions to a community, apart from a critical tool for onboarding users who wish to contribute to a community looking for new talent or members who are aligned with its values and vision. Participating in quests allows communities to interact with communities outside their ecosystem and tap into new streams of human capital to achieve new goals.
        <br /><br />
        Quests also enable communities the talent it takes to create value across the ecosystem from within their ranks and openly allow anyone to participate, regardless of background. It’s all about delivering the task at hand and offering your marketable skills and value to the community one way or another. It builds your on-chain reputation and identity as a trustworthy, reliable member of the community with verifiable proof of your participation. And there’s a lot of ongoing demand for talent who can do just that.
        <br /><br />
        Rewarding community members for participation and engagement allows them to reward users for their contribution and offers the perfect way to put new members through their paces - akin to a learn-to-earn model.
